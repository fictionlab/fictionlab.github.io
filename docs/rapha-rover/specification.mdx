### RaphaCore controller

RaphaCore serves as the primary control board for Rapha Rover, featuring a
robust STM32H5 series microcontroller. The board leverages FreeRTOS to
efficiently handle various low-level tasks integral to the functioning of Rapha
Rover. These tasks include:

- Drivetrain control
- Power system management
- LED control
- IMU operation
- Odometry tracking

    ),
  }}
  width="2000"
  height="1375"
/>

### Drivetrain

The standard configuration of the Rapha Rover features a drivetrain comprising
two fixed wheels at the front and two rotary wheels at the rear. This design
enhances the mobility of the Rover, enabling it to execute precise maneuvers
such as:

- turning in place ( around middle point between frontal wheels)
- turning around specific frontal wheel
- turning around a curve

This versatile drivetrain configuration optimizes the Rover's navigational
capabilities, ensuring adaptability in various operational scenarios.

#### Motors

The Rapha Rover is equipped with 6 DirectDriveTech M0601C-111 direct-drive BLDC
motors, serving both the drive and turn functions. These motors enable the rover
to attain a speed of approximately 1.8 m/s when equipped with standard diameter
tires. Each motor is outfitted with an integrated incremental encoder with a
resolution of 12 bits.

To mitigate potential operational challenges, a mechanical bumper restricts the
turn angle of each steering wheel to 180°. This bumper not only acts as a limit
for wheel rotation but also serves to establish the wheel's position when the
rover is restarted, ensuring consistent and reliable performance.

#### Wheels

As standard, Rapha Rover comes with rubber tires with a diameter of about 170
mm. Whole drive assembly has following characteristics:

|                        Parameter |           Value           |
| -------------------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| Tire size (diameter x thickness) |    ~ 170 mm x ~ 80 mm     |
|                   Tire lock type |         Beadlock          |
|                      Tire insert | hard foam (non pneumatic) |
|               Wheel rim diameter |          120 mm           |

### Battery & charging

Rapha Rover boasts an advanced battery management system, a feature enabling the
simultaneous utilization of two battery packs. This innovative system empowers
the rover to seamlessly operate for approximately four continuous hours under
decent conditions (e.g. relatively flat terrain). The dual-battery configuration
enhances the overall endurance and sustained performance of the rover.

A notable feature of the design is the ability to detach the battery packs
without requiring a power-off cycle. By connecting the charger to the rear slot
of the Rover, users can safely remove both batteries. This functionality
streamlines the process of swift and efficient battery replacements, resulting
in minimal downtime during operations. The seamless swapping of battery packs
not only extends the operational range of the rover but also mitigates the
necessity for frequent service stops, thereby elevating the overall efficiency
and productivity of the robotic platform.

Each battery pack has following characteristics:

|            Parameter |                  Value                   |
| -------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|              Voltage |             22.2 V (nominal)             |
|         Battery type |                  Li-Ion                  |
|             Capacity |        4 Ah (96 Wh - flight safe)        |
|    Battery pack type |                   6S1P                   |
| Maximum output power |                  ~650 W                  |
|       Safety systems | Overcurrent, Reverse polarity protection |

#### Battery charging

By default Rapha Rover comes with 2A 25,2V Li-Ion charger. It can charge 1
battery pack in about 2,5 hours.

Rapha Rover has 2 options for charging batteries:

- Outside the Rover, by plugging battery into charger
- Inside the Rover, by plugging charger directly into rear charging slot of the
  Rover

The charger is outfitted with an LED status indicator designed to provide
information about the charging status of the battery. A green LED signifies that
the battery has reached full charge, while a red LED indicates that the battery
is currently in the charging process.

:::note

When charging the batteries with the Rover powered on, the LED indicator will
not transition to green during the charging cycle. This is due to the fact that
the charger will be used to sustain the operational state of the rover after the
charging process.

### Payload specification

Rapha Rover is designed to be used with custom payloads. Main mounting plate is
located at the top of the rover and has following characteristics:

|                                  Parameter |                                                  Value                                                   |
| -----------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                           Payload capacity |                                                  ~10 kg                                                  |
|                          Hole grid spacing |                                              25 mm x 25 mm                                               |
|                   Mounting hole dimensions | 5.4 mm, compatible with: <br /> M5 screws <br/> CLS-M4-1 press-in nuts [example](https://mou.sr/3VyUg39) |
| Main mounting plate dimensions (L x W x D) |                                         330 mm x 198 mm x 2 mm\*                                         |

\* - actual maximum payload length is lower due to Lidar mounted at the front of
the plate and buttons at the rear.

Apart from the mounting plate, it is possible to mount payloads directly to
v-slot extrusions of the Rapha Rover.

#### Rover's external ports

Rapha Rover has a special rear compartment provided as easy access to connect
many payloads. As default provided are following interfaces:

| Interface  |                        Notes                         |
| :--------: | :--------------------------------------------------: |

| USB type C | USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 (10 Gb/s), connected to UPBoard 7000 |
|   RJ-45    |   10/100/1000 Mbps, connected to Teltonika RUTX10    |

In addition, the rear compartment also includes a power panel with 3 sections,
each with different voltage levels. Each section can be individually controlled
by RaphaCore. Voltages available on power panel are:

|    Voltage    |  Max power  |                                                                               Connector                                                                               |

To ensure weather-tightness while accommodating additional payloads, the Rapha
Rover is equipped with specialized cable seals. To insert additional cables, it
is necessary to dismantle the entire panel by loosening two thumb screws. Once
the panel is disassembled, individual seals can be removed from the frame,
allowing for the insertion of new cables.

Rapha Rover comes with different seals, labeled as QT [Z]/[X] or QT [X], where Z
indicates the number of holes in the seal and X indicates the diameter of the
cable in millimeters.

#### Additional mounting plates

Beyond the primary mounting plate, the Rapha Rover offers the capability for
integration with supplementary mounting plates as needed. These additional
plates are colloquially known as "sandwich plates" due to their placement above
the main mounting plate. This design ensures that a payload affixed to the Rover
does not impede the Lidar's line of sight.

To install these additional mounting plates, begin by removing the bolts
securing the main mounting plate. Subsequently, affix the M5 x 25 standoffs
(provided with the Rover), in place of the removed bolts. Following this step,
place the mounting plate onto the standoffs and secure it in position by
fastening it with the screws that were initially holding the main mounting plate
in place.

:::tip

Holes on additional mounting plates exactly match ones located on the main
