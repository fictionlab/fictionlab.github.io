:::note

Rapha Rover is still in beta and not available for sale at this time.

:::

Rapha Rover is a versatile platform designed for a wide range of robotic
projects, from inspection to agriculture and construction. Built to integrate
with custom payloads and operate in diverse environments, it's perfect for both
indoor and outdoor applications. (Note: Beta version is limited to indoor use
only.) This guide will help you get started with everything you need to know,
including setup, charging, internet connectivity, and SSH access for a seamless
experience with your new rover.

- a little surprise

## Connecting the battery

Each Rapha Rover is equipped with two dedicated 24V Li-Ion battery packs.

:::warning

Make sure that there is no debris inside the slots or in the battery connectors!

:::

To power the rover, insert these battery packs into their designated slots
located on either side of the rover. Ensure proper alignment and secure the
batteries in place to guarantee uninterrupted power supply.

The batteries are secured by ball catches, which provide slight resistance
during insertion and removal. A properly inserted battery should be fully nested
within the slot.

To verify proper battery insertion, refer to the image below:

To verify proper battery insertion, press the power button once. If the
batteries have remaining charge, the LEDs on the sides of the device will
illuminate to display the current battery charge level. The charge level is
indicated by an LED bar that shows the percentage of battery capacity remaining.

## How to turn on the rover

After inserting the battery, the rover is ready to be powered on. To power on
the rover, press and hold the power button located at the rear of the rover.
While holding the button, a green bar will appear on the rear LED strip. This
bar will progressively fill the rear LED strip. Once the bar fully fills the
strip, the rover will power on.

The rover's power-on state will be indicated by a single green breath pulse of
all LED strips.

### Turning the rover off

To power off the rover, follow the same procedure as for powering it on. The
main difference is that the rear LED bar will be red instead of green. The
rover's power-off state will be indicated by a single red breath pulse of all
LED strips.
