### Drivetrain

The standard configuration of the Rapha Rover features a drivetrain comprising
two fixed wheels at the front and two rotary wheels at the rear. This design
enhances the mobility of the Rover, enabling it to execute precise maneuvers
such as:

- turning in place ( around middle point between frontal wheels)
- turning around specific frontal wheel
- turning around a curve

This versatile drivetrain configuration optimizes the Rover's navigational
capabilities, ensuring adaptability in various operational scenarios.

#### Motors

The Rapha Rover is equipped with 6 DirectDriveTech M0601C-111 direct-drive BLDC
motors, serving both the drive and turn functions. These motors enable the rover
to attain a speed of approximately 1.8 m/s when equipped with standard diameter
tires. Each motor is outfitted with an integrated incremental encoder with a
resolution of 12 bits.

To mitigate potential operational challenges, a mechanical bumper restricts the
turn angle of each steering wheel to 180°. This bumper not only acts as a limit
for wheel rotation but also serves to establish the wheel's position when the
rover is restarted, ensuring consistent and reliable performance.

#### Wheels

As standard, Rapha Rover comes with rubber tires with a diameter of about 170
mm. Whole drive assembly has following characteristics:

|                        Parameter |           Value           |
| -------------------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| Tire size (diameter x thickness) |    ~ 170 mm x ~ 80 mm     |
|                   Tire lock type |         Beadlock          |
|                      Tire insert | hard foam (non pneumatic) |
|               Wheel rim diameter |          120 mm           |

### Battery & charging

Rapha Rover boasts an advanced battery management system, a feature enabling the
simultaneous utilization of two battery packs. This innovative system empowers
the rover to seamlessly operate for approximately four continuous hours under
decent conditions (e.g. relatively flat terrain). The dual-battery configuration
enhances the overall endurance and sustained performance of the rover.

A notable feature of the design is the ability to detach the battery packs
without requiring a power-off cycle. By connecting the charger to the rear slot
of the Rover, users can safely remove both batteries. This functionality
streamlines the process of swift and efficient battery replacements, resulting
in minimal downtime during operations. The seamless swapping of battery packs
not only extends the operational range of the rover but also mitigates the
necessity for frequent service stops, thereby elevating the overall efficiency
and productivity of the robotic platform.

Each battery pack has following characteristics:

|            Parameter |                  Value                   |
| -------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|              Voltage |             22.2 V (nominal)             |
|         Battery type |                  Li-Ion                  |
|             Capacity |        4 Ah (96 Wh - flight safe)        |
|    Battery pack type |                   6S1P                   |
| Maximum output power |                  ~650 W                  |
|       Safety systems | Overcurrent, Reverse polarity protection |

#### Battery charging

By default Rapha Rover comes with 2A 25,2V Li-Ion charger. It can charge 1
battery pack in about 2,5 hours.

Rapha Rover has 2 options for charging batteries:

- Outside the Rover, by plugging battery into charger
- Inside the Rover, by plugging charger directly into rear charging slot of the
  Rover

The charger is outfitted with an LED status indicator designed to provide
information about the charging status of the battery. A green LED signifies that
the battery has reached full charge, while a red LED indicates that the battery
is currently in the charging process.

:::note

When charging the batteries with the Rover powered on, the LED indicator will
not transition to green during the charging cycle. This is due to the fact that
the charger will be used to sustain the operational state of the rover after the
charging process.

To ensure weather-tightness while accommodating additional payloads, the Rapha
Rover is equipped with specialized cable seals. To insert additional cables, it
is necessary to dismantle the entire panel by loosening two thumb screws. Once
the panel is disassembled, individual seals can be removed from the frame,
allowing for the insertion of new cables.

Rapha Rover comes with different seals, labeled as QT [Z]/[X] or QT [X], where Z
indicates the number of holes in the seal and X indicates the diameter of the
cable in millimeters.

#### Additional mounting plates

Beyond the primary mounting plate, the Rapha Rover offers the capability for
integration with supplementary mounting plates as needed. These additional
plates are colloquially known as "sandwich plates" due to their placement above
the main mounting plate. This design ensures that a payload affixed to the Rover
does not impede the Lidar's line of sight.

To install these additional mounting plates, begin by removing the bolts
securing the main mounting plate. Subsequently, affix the M5 x 25 standoffs
(provided with the Rover), in place of the removed bolts. Following this step,

## Software specification

### Overview

Rapha Rover's software heavily relies on The
[Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://ros.org/) which offers the robot the
following functionalities:

- Abstraction layer facilitating communication between software components.
- Open-source software components, maintained by the community.
- A collection of standard message interfaces.
- Tools for introspection.

The primary segment of the software stack is partitioned into several
[ROS Nodes](https://wiki.ros.org/Nodes), treated as computational units, each
doing one logical thing. The nodes interact via:

- **Topics** - Named buses enabling message exchange between nodes. They are
  strongly typed and employ anonymous publish/subscribe semantics.
- **Services** - A client/server mechanism for remote procedure calls between
  nodes. The service server accepts remote procedure requests identified by name
  and type, which must be known to the service client beforehand.
- **Parameters** - Sets of key/value pairs maintained separately by each node,
  utilized for node configuration during startup and runtime without
  necessitating code modifications.
- **TF transforms** - A single transform describes the relationship between 2
  coordinate frames at a specific point in time. TF transforms are distributed
  between nodes using topics, but, for the sake of clarity, we will refer to
  them as separate entities.

There are two important software components which don't run as native ROS nodes:

- **Controller firmware** - The firmware itself acts as a ROS node but uses
  eProsima's
  [Micro XRCE-DDS](https://micro-xrce-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/) as its
  middleware. Thus, it requires the presence of the Micro-ROS Agent on the
  built-in computer to communicate with other ROS nodes.
- **Web User Interface** - The WebUI establishes a connection with the Rosbridge
  Server via WebSocket transport layer and employs the rosbridge protocol for
  communication with the ROS nodes.

        including:

        - State of the dynamic joints controlled by RaphaCore.
        - Data retrieved from the onboard IMU sensor.
        - Power system status, comprising:
          - Battery voltages.
          - Connection status of batteries or the charger to the robot.
          - Current output power.
        - Computed odometry.
        - Diagnostic information for various system components.

        Parses the kinematic tree model of the robot in URDF format and broadcasts the
        robot state using TF transforms. Here's how it operates:

        - Fixed joints, like sensor positions, are published as static transforms.
        - Movable joints, such as wheel states, are published as dynamic transforms,
          based on the current joint states published by the Controller Node.

        It also publishes the robot URDF description on a designated topic, making it
        easily accessible to other nodes.

        - Calibration parameters for each image sensor.

Different robot applications will require running different sets of additional
nodes on top of the core ones. For example, consider a situation where we want
to autonomously drive to predefined coordinates in an unknown terrain. Typical
solution can be simplified to 2 nodes:

- SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping) node - generates a 2D terrain map
  and localizes the robot within it.
- Autonomous Navigation node - Retrieves navigation goals and outputs drive
  commands for the controller. Uses 2D terrain map to plan an optimized path and
  data from LiDAR and stereo camera to detect dynamic obstacles.

These nodes can be configured to start alongside the core ones, extending the
robot with autonomous navigation capabilities.

### Firmware

_Work in progress_

#### LED controller

The built-in LED controller manages the LED states of the robot by processing
user-defined states and animations, integrating them with ongoing animations,
and updating the LEDs accordingly.

Users can control the LED strip by specifying colors, duration, and priority of
specific LEDs. This allows for in-depth control, enabling users to determine
which LED states are the most important. Critical states, such as errors, are
displayed over less important uses, like illuminating the surroundings.

The robot features four LED panels that combine to form one long LED strip. LEDs
can be controlled either as a full strip or as specific panels, providing
flexibility for different use cases:

- **Full Strip Control**: Ideal for animations that span the entire perimeter of
  the robot, such as police lights.
- **Panel-Specific Control**: Useful for targeted functions, such as using all
  front LEDs as a flashlight or using side LEDs to indicate battery levels.

### Web User Interface

The beta version of the Rapha rover does not feature a User Interface (UI). The
software is fully operational in terms of functionality; however, the absence of
a UI necessitates interaction through Command Line Interface (CLI) or other
programming methods.
