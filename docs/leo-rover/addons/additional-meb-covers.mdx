A stock Main Electronics Box is designed to be waterproof and to encapsule all
the electronics needed for the Rover operation. However, Core2ROS board provides
much more functionalities than the ones needed for default use. To take
advantage of the functionalities you'll need to either mount your own
electronics inside or outside of the Box.

Below you'll get example designs of the covers and mounting plates prepared to
start your own projects.

All the files are available in our Google Drive:

## 00188 - Closed MEB cover

This one comes stock with the Rover. It's designed to be watertight and provide
4x M3 mounting points for 00189 Mounting Plate.

## 00188_dev - Easy-access cover

If you don't need any water protection and need to route any cables for
additional electronics - the best way is to use the easy-access cover. It
provides a 120x12mm opening at the rear of MEB.

## 00189 - Internal mounting plate

It's designed to fit both stock and Dev-Covers. The plate has a grid of 11x7
4.8mm holes (to fit M4 screws) and is 3mm thick. If you don't want to redesign
the plate and need something to connect your own electronics, just 3d-print this
one as a starting point.

Mind that the mounting points in the covers are provided with no threaded
inserts. You can assemble the mounting plates using brass threaded inserts that
are heat-pressed in the 3d-print using a soldering iron. Make sure you get the
inserts before you print your own cover:

## 00189_smooth - Editable mounting plate

This one is easier to open in any 3d-modelling software to just add any holes
and extrusions you need for your projects.
