This tutorial will guide you through the procedure of docking your Leo Rover
autonomously to the charging station.

## Software integration

### Preparing the environment

To be able to perform the autonomous docking, you need to install our package on
your rover. For now the only way is to build it from source, so it requires a
ROS workspace on your rover (if you don't have one or don't know whether there
is already a workspace on your rover, you can follow
[this guide](/leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development#building-additional-ros-packages)).

To install the package, connect to your rover through ssh, enter the `src`
directory inside your workspace and execute these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_docking.git
cd ..
source devel/setup.bash
rosdep install --from-paths src -iry
catkin build
```

### Launching the software

Now that everything is ready, we can proceed to launching some software. This
whole section will describe in detail the functionalities provided in the
`leo_docking` package and how to use them.

Here's a brief summary of different parts of the docking software we will run:

- Aruco Detector - it's necessary for detecting the charging station; provides
  the docking process with needed coordinates.
- Docking state machine - once we have the position of the station, it will be
  used to set up the rover's position regarding the station and perform docking.
- Docking Client - the way of controlling the process of the docking
  (starting/aborting) and getting feedback from the autonomous docking.

The first two functions are provided through the launch file located under the
**launch** directory. All parameters for the running nodes are loaded from the
YAML files located under the **config** directory.

The client is run with `rosrun` command and takes three optional arguments, but
it'll be covered later.

#### Detector + State Machine

As the state machine needs output from the detector, they are launched with one
file. The detector provides the state machine with the station position in the
`base_link` frame, and the state machine performs calculations and moves the
rover based on the results. The machine has 3 main parts:

- **Reaching docking area** - the machine enters this part when the rover is not
  able to simple dock to the station from its starting position. The task of
  this part is to get the rover in front of the station in some distance, facing
  the station.
- **Reaching docking point** - this part is responsible for getting the rover
  right in front of the charging station where it'll be possible to make final
  corrections in the position before riding onto the station.
- **Docking** - the last part of the docking process that makes the rover dock
  at the station; makes the rover drive onto the station until one of three
  conditions are met:
  - charging is detected
  - distance to the marker on the station has been reached
  - the wheels are blocked on the station - the rover reached the end of the
    station.

Here's a diagram that illustrates the state machine:

:::info

The ovals represent different states of the machine and the arrows show the
transitions between the states. The two gray rectangles represent sub state
machines to the main state machine.

:::

When it comes to the parameters, there are three files in the config directory:

- **board_descriptions.yaml** - file containing definitions of 4 boards with
  aruco markers.

:::danger

As the definitions are matched to the boards that we provide on the stations,
it's better not to change values there if you don't know what the parameters
mean.

:::

- **aruco_tracker.yaml** - file containing parameters for the opencv aruco
  detector function and some ROS specific parameters.

:::warning

It's better not to change the ROS specific parameters. For the description of
the opencv detector parameters, you can visit this link.

:::

- docking_config.yaml - file with all parameters for the state machine. You can
  specify there linear and angular speed of the rover in specific states,
  timeouts and more. Each parameter has it's comment describing what this
  parameter is used for. There are also a few commented params - you can
  uncomment them to specify the value for a given state (as long as the param is
  commented, the value to the state is provided from the global parameter
  defined in the beginning of the file).

:::warning

Although you have access to every file with parameters, it would be best not to
touch any of the values unless you really need to because some part of the
autonomous docking doesn't suit you. But remember that with wrong parameter
setup the autonomous docking might not succeed.

:::

Having everything covered, to run the detector with the state machine, simply
run on the rover:

```bash
roslaunch leo_docking dock_rover.launch
```

:::info

Remember to source the setup.bash file in your ROS workspace. Otherwise, the
command will fail.

#### Docking Client

Having the software described above launched, we have the state machine ready
for action, but it needs a signal to start the docking. That's where the Docking
Client comes in. It's a script that sends an ID of the target charging station
(the marker board on the station to be precise) to the state machine. Once the
state machine gets the number, it starts the docking process. Here are all the
functionalities that the docking client provides:

- Starting the docking process by sending a goal to the state machine actionlib
  server,
- Possibility of cancelling the docking with the ctrl+c key combination,
- Getting feedback from the state machine,
- Checking if the state machine is up or whether it stopped working during the
  docking process,
- Three optional command line arguments that are respectively: **ID of the
  base**, **connection timeout**, **status check interval**.

The command to run the client looks like this:

```bash
rosrun leo_docking docking_client <board_id> <timeout> <interval>
```

But as it was mentioned earlier, the arguments are optional, so a simple command
to start the docking process is (in another terminal, with sourced workspace):

```bash
rosrun leo_docking docking_client
```

This will use the default values of the arguments ("1", "3", "2" respectively).
Here is a customized example:

```bash
rosrun leo_docking docking_client 3 2 1.5
```

This command will result in the state machine trying to dock the rover to the
station with ID "3", where the client will wait 2 seconds for getting connection
with the state machine actionlib server and will check every 1.5 second if the
server is still up.

:::info

You can also run the docking client on your host computer, but you would need to
build the `leo_docking` package there and connect your rover to the ROS network
running on the rover. You can do this by following
[this guide](/leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development#connecting-another-computer-to-ros-network).
