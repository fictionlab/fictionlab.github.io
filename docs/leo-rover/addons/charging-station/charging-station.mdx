The charging station for the Leo Rover has been engineered to prolong the
operational duration of the rover by facilitating battery recharging without
necessitating shutdown. It features a battery level indicator and an AR-Tag
board to enable autonomous docking capabilities.

## Additional features:

- Battery level display,
- Holes for mounting the station to a surface,
- Autonomous docking possibility based on the ARTag,
- Compatibility with standard Leo Rover chargers,
- Ability to autonomously center the rover on the station,
- Protection against aggressive driving onto the station - once positioned, the
  rover will be locked in place,
- Easy plug & play modification of the rover - only requires changing the cover
  and connecting cables,
- Possibility of hot-swapping batteries on the station - without turning off the
  rover.

## Charging process:

:::note

A rover with a modified MEB cover with charging pads is required. Modified MEB
cover is provided with the station.

:::

1. The rover docks to the station - either by teleoperation or autonomously.
2. During docking, the rover's position is adjusted by the shape of the station
   to perfectly align with the pads.
3. The charging process starts once the pads on the rover touch the pads on the
   station.
4. The LED on the charging station changes color depending on the rover's charge
   level.

### LED colors:

- Steady green: ~90% charge
- Steady yellow: ~70% charge
- Slow blinking yellow: ~50% charge
- Fast blinking yellow: ~20% charge
- Steady red: ~10% charge
- Slow blinking red: ~5-7% charge
- Fast blinking red: Below 5% charge

:::note

Due to the characteristics of lithium-ion batteries, it is recommended to leave
the fully charged rover on the station for some time in order to balance the
battery cells (do not remove the rover immediately after the green LED lights
up).

:::

### Safety:

Currently, the station has no safety features - beware not to place anything
metal on it (with contact to the pads); otherwise, it may result in damage to
the charger.
