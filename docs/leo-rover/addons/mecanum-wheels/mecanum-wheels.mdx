Mecanum wheels are a type of omnidirectional wheel design that allows a robotic
platform, like the Leo Rover, to move in any direction instantly without
changing its orientation. This is achieved through a series of rollers angled at
45 degrees to the axis of rotation, enabling lateral and diagonal movement, as
well as rotation on the spot, providing unparalleled maneuverability.
