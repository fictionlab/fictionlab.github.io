### How long does it take to assemble the Rover?

It should take you about 8 hours.

### Do I need to buy anything other than Dev Kit to build the Rover?

No, the Kit is designed to include every component needed.

### What tools and knowledge do I need to assemble the Rover?

All the needed tools are provided with the kit. As to knowledge, no skills are
required, but assembling the rover will surely go more smoothly if you know what
you're doing. A lot of patience and persistence will be an asset too :)

### What is in the box?

In the unboxing video, Szymon shows what you can expect when you finally get the
Leo Rover Developer Kit on your workbench and start digging in the boxes.

### Can I write my own software to the Rover?

Yes, of course. The Rover is developer-ready. You can learn more on
`docs.leorover.tech` or on Github. The software is open-source and written the
way it's easy to navigate. On top of that, our team can provide you with support
in case something is not clear.

### Is the Rover autonomous?

By default Leo Rover is remotely controlled with video streaming and UI
ready-to-go. It's not autonomous, but it's autonomy-ready. The software is based
on Robot Operating System (ROS) which is known for easiness of autonomy and
semi-autonomy features implementation. The simplest way is to add a lidar or
stereovision camera to enhance the Rover self-navigation and then build your
features on top of that. The Rover itself has one front camera and 4 wheel
encoders onboard, so it provides video streaming and basic odometry
out-of-the-box.

### Does Leo Rover send any data back to the manufacturer?

No. And we're extremely cautious not to do that in the future. Everything that
happens in the Rover is between you and the software. We don't gather any data
and connecting the Rover to the Internet is only for your own convenience.
