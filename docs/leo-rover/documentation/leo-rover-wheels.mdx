## Wheel motors

### Bühler Motors 1.61.077.414

Leo Rover v1.8 (as well as older Turtle Rover) uses Bühler motors as the wheels
actuators. Here, you have all the useful resources listed in case you need to
access the motors specifications.

| GND         | GND PIN of Core2ROS / LeoCore                                |

### Dimension drawings

Mind that the encoder magnets are modified to fit Bühler Motors shaft. Internal
hole is redrilled to 3 mm (instead of 1.5 mm).

### Wheel tires

Tire specifications:

- Inner rim diameter: 2.8" (~71mm)
- Outer diameter: ~125 mm
- Width: ~70 mm
- Typically described as for 1/10 scale Monster Truck RC vehicles

:::info

The dimensions may vary +- 10mm with no compatibility issues, remember the tires
are made of rubber, they can stretch.

:::

You can always look for different outer diameter tires, but it will change the
rover's speed and force (slope/climbing ability). You can as well find different
rubber compounds: softer or tougher ones. Keep in mind that softer compounds
will affect Leo Rover's turning resistance, but on the other hand, will help it
climb obstacles.

_Higher outer diameter = higher speed & lower force_

_Lower outer diameter = lower speed & higher force_

It's always a matter of compromise.

$$
\text{Rover Speed}~\Big\lbrack\frac{m}{s}\Big\rbrack = \frac{ \text{wheel diameter [m]} * \pi * \text{motor speed [RPM]}}{ 60 }
$$

$$
\text{Rover Force [N]} = \frac{4 * \text{motor torque [Nm]}}{\text{wheel diameter[m]}}
$$
