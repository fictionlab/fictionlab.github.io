  servos with ROS. Includes setup guide and example code.

:::warning

This integration is not compatible with Leo Rover v1.8. It is kept on site for
legacy purposes.

This tutorial will show you how to use the Arbotix-M Robocontroller board to
control DYNAMIXEL servos with ROS.

## Prerequisites

## Flash the Arbotix board

Before you can use the Arbotix board with ROS, you need to flash a proper
firmware. Follow the
[Quick Start Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20210506193606/https://learn.trossenrobotics.com/arbotix/7-arbotix-quick-start-guide)
from TrossenRobotics to learn how to program the board with Arduino IDE.

If you have successfully programmed the example sketches, open the ros sketch
from `Arbotix Sketches` (**File** -> **Sketchbook** -> **ArbotiX Sketches** ->
**ros**).

<ImageZoom

  height="729"
/>

Then **compile it** (the green check button) and **upload** (the green arrow
button) to the board.

The rest of this tutorial can be done in any machine that runs ROS and have an
Internet connection. It can be Leo Rover:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/ssh" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/connect-to-network" />

or your computer:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/install-ros-on-your-computer" />

## Install Arbotix ROS driver

The driver for Arbotix board is distributed in
[arbotix](http://wiki.ros.org/arbotix) package. It can be installed from
official repository just by typing:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-arbotix
```

## Set Dynamixel IDs and test the servos

Make sure your setup looks like this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/arbotix/arbotix-setup.webp"
  width="1760"
  height="1829"
/>

Then, type in your terminal:

```bash
arbotix_terminal
```

:::info

As `arbotix_terminal` is a ROS command, remember to source your `devel`
workspace before you call it, if you are doing the tutorial on your computer.

:::note

`arbotix_terminal` by default, assumes the board is connected on `/dev/ttyUSB0`
port. If it is attached to another device, you can specify it like this:

```bash
arbotix_terminal [PORT]
```

To check which port the device connects to, you can, for instance, run
`dmesg -w` (**Ctrl+C** to exit), connect the device and check kernel logs.

If you are using Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux, you need to open Device
Manager and look under Ports for COM port number of the device. `COM[N]`
corresponds to `/dev/ttyS[N]` path. (e.g. **COM4** -> `/dev/ttyS4`). You might
need to run:

```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyS[N]
```

:::

A terminal prompt should appear. Type `help` for the list of commands.

<ImageZoom

/>

Connect the Dynamixel you want to set id to. Then type ls to see id of connected
servo.

:::note

Sometimes to get list of the connected servos, you may have to run ls command
couple times.

:::

ype `mv [source] [target]` to change it. For example, when the servo has ID 1
and we want to set it to 2, just type:

```bash
mv 1 2
```

:::warning

When you have connected multiple servos, this command will change ALL servos
with `ID [source]` (1 in this example) to `ID [target]`.

:::

You can also read and change some parameters to test servo movement with `get`
and `set` commands. For example, to read current position of servo with ID 1,
type:

```bash
get pos 1
```

To move the servo to position 300 (the range is between 0 and 1023), type:

```bash
set pos 1 300
```

To set the goal speed of the servo to half of the maximum, type:

```bash
set spd 1 512
```

The servo should start moving continuously in one direction.

## Test the ROS driver

We will create a package that tests the arbotix driver. Let's start by creating
a catkin workspace (if you don't have one yet):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src && cd ~/ros_ws/
catkin init
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}
```

and an empty package:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src
catkin create pkg arbotix_test --catkin-deps arbotix_python
```

Inside the package, create `config/test.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
port: /dev/ttyUSB0
rate: 15
joints:
  {
    dynamixel1: { id: 1 },
    dynamixel2: { id: 2 },
    dynamixel3: { id: 3 },
    dynamixel4: { id: 4 },
    dynamixel5: { id: 5 },
  }
```

:::warning

You might need to change the port parameter

:::

:::info

You can set more parameters for each joint, like maximum speed, minimum and
maximum angle etc. A brief documentation (Unfortunately, a little outdated) can
be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/arbotix_python#Parameters).

:::

And `launch/test.launch` with the following:

```xml
<launch>
  <node name="arbotix_driver_test" pkg="arbotix_python" type="arbotix_driver" output="screen">
    <rosparam file="$(find arbotix_test)/config/test.yaml" command="load" />
  </node>
</launch>
```

Build the package and source the result space:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash
```

Now, run the launch file, by typing:

```bash
roslaunch arbotix_test test.launch
```

You should see new topics spawned (check with rostopic list):

```bash
/joint_states
/dynamixel1/command
/dynamixel2/command
/dynamixel3/command
/dynamixel4/command
/dynamixel5/command
```

And new services (check with `rosservice list`):

```bash
/dynamixel1/enable
/dynamixel1/relax
/dynamixel1/set_speed
/dynamixel2/enable
...
```

To shortly summarize the features:

- `/dynamixelX/command` topic will enable the torque and move the servo with ID
  X to a specified position if published to. The position is specified in
  radians.
- `/dynamixelX/enable` service will just enable the torque on the servo.
- `/dynamixelX/relax` service will relax the servo (disable the torque).
- `/dynamixelX/set_speed` service will set the speed the servo will move with
  when it receives a new command. The speed is specified in radians per second.
- The current joint positions and velocities are published to `/joint_states`
  topic.

We can try to test the features using `rostopic` and `rosservice` tools.

Assuming you have connected the servo with ID 1, start by setting the speed to a
safe value (0.2 rad/s in this case):

```bash
rosservice call /dynamixel1/set_speed 0.2
```

Move servo to a default neutral value:

```bash
rostopic pub /dynamixel1/command std_msg/Float64 -- 0.0
```

:::info

The maximum angle range for a Dynamixel servo is [-150, 150] degrees which is equal
to approximately [-2.62, 2.62] in radians

:::

Relax joint:

```bash
rosservice call /dynamixel1/relax
```
