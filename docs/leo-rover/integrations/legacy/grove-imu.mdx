:::tip

Since Leo Rover v1.8 IMU is already integrated into LeoCore controller. You
don't have to integrate it.

:::

:::warning

This integration is not compatible with Leo Rover v1.8. It is kept on site for
legacy purposes.

:::

In this tutorial, we will show you how to connect and use a Grove inertial
measurement unit module on your Rover.

## Prerequisites

First, make sure you have a compatible IMU module. The firmware supports only
the `MPU-9250` sensors. We recommend the **Grove - IMU 9DOF v2.0** board but
most modules with this sensor should work.

IMU functionality was introduced in
[leo_firmware](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_firmware/releases) version 0.5,
so make sure to stay updated.

## Mounting and wiring the sensor

By default, the IMU will work on `hSense2` port. You can change it to `hSense1`
by modifying the
[params.h](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_firmware/blob/master/params.h) file
in `leo_firmware`.

  height="791"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

Connect the sensor pins according to the
[CORE2 manual](https://husarion.com/manuals/core2/#hsensor).

/>

| hSense pin | IMU pin |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 3          | SCL     |
| 4          | SDA     |
| 5          | +5V     |
| 6          | GND     |

You can use female jumper cables, or create your own IDC cable, like this one:

  }}
/>

If you use the Grove IMU, you can 3D print the mounting plate for the MEB cover
which contains holes for the self-tapping screws (00189_imu part). The files can
be found here:

## Integrating the sensor with the system

### Turning on the IMU functionality

Start a remote terminal session on the Rover via SSH.

To set IMU functionality on or off, you need to call the `/core2/set_imu`
service.

```bash
rosservice call /core2/set_imu true
```

Now, you need to reset the board to apply changes. You can do this by turning on
and off the whole Rover, or by calling the `/core2/reset_board` service:

```bash
rosservice call /core2/reset_board
```

After the board reset, new topics should spawn: `/imu/gyro`, `/imu/accel`,
`/imu/mag` on which IMU gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer readings are
published (you can check available topics with `rostopic list`).

Check if the readings are correct with `rostopic echo`, for example:

```bash
rostopic echo /imu/gyro
```

### Sensor axes and units

The sensor's accelerometer and gyroscope X, Y and Z axes should be printed on
the board. If they are not, you can check MPU9250 IC orientation and identify
the axes with this drawing:

  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/groove-imu/imu-axes.webp"
  width="283"
  height="240"
  figStyle={{
    width: 400,
  }}
/>

The magnetometer axes were also transformed to these axes to comply with the
North-West-Up world frame.

The gyroscope data (`imu/gyro` topic) represents angular velocity around
sensor's axes in rad/s (radians per second). The accelerometer data (`imu/accel`
topic) represents linear acceleration along sensor's axes in m/s2 (meters per
second squared). The magnetometer data (`imu/mag` topic) represents magnetic
field along sensor's axes in G (Gauss).

### Extending the URDF model

The system should be aware of where the module is located on the robot in order
to be able to use the sensor readings. To specify the location, you can extend
the URDF model of Leo Rover by editing the `/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro`.
Simply open the file in `nano` editor by typing:

```bash
nano /etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro
```

Add these lines somewhere between the `<robot>` tags:

```xml
<link name="imu"/>

<joint name="imu_joint" type="fixed">
  <parent link="base_link"/>
  <child link="imu"/>
  <origin xyz="0.027 0 -0.07" rpy="0 0 0"/>
</joint>
```

`imu link` represents the reference frame of the sensor readings.

`base_link` is the origin of the robot.

`imu_joint` specifies the transformation between these two links.

:::info

You might need to modify the transformation (`<origin>` tag) depending on how
you mounted the module.

/>

For more information, visit **ROS Development** -> **Adding additional
functionality to the rover** -> **expanding the URDF model**

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

After modifying the description, restart the nodes to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

To check if it's working correctly, you can check for the transformation between
`base_link` and `imu` frames:

```bash
rosrun tf tf_echo base_link imu
```

### Calibrating the sensor

The firmware also provides services that perform sensor calibration and store
the results in a persistent storage.

#### Calibrate gyroscope and accelerometer biases

To calibrate gyroscope and accelerometer biases, just place the Rover on a flat
surface, parallel to the ground and call the calibration service:

```bash
rosservice call /imu/calibrate_gyro_accel
```

#### Calibrate magnetometer

Calibrating the magnetometer is a bit more difficult task, as it requires
collection of a whole range of measurements on each axis. The method that works
best is to move the sensor in a 3-dimensional figure eight, however, such motion
can be hard to accomplish with the whole Rover.

To start the calibration, just call the service:

```bash
rosservice call /imu/calibrate_mag
```

After 4 seconds, the firmware should start data collection. After another 15
seconds, the service should return success message. Try to move the sensor in a
varied motion for the whole duration of the service call.

:::warning

When you change the sensor position on the Rover, the hard-iron distortion may
change and invalidate previous calibration data, so, before performing the
magnetometer calibration, make sure the sensor is located at the designated
place
