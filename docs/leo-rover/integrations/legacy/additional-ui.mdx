## Prerequisites

This tutorial describes how to include an additional UI to be running on the
LeoRover. We will show you all the needed steps to include a new interface and
reconfigure the HTTP server.

The tutorial will be based on the sample UI dedicated to controlling the
additional relay module.

The following tutorial will be presenting the configuration of a new user
interface in the Leo Rover system running on RPi (LeoOS). Before starting the
following steps, you need to provide two things- Internet connection and ssh
connection.Connect via SSH.

The Internet connection is necessary to download the repository from GH, as well
as the ssh connection is needed to have access to LeoOS terminal remotely. All
the operations presented below need to be applied in LeoOS remote terminal via
ssh.

## Clone the UI files

The first step is to download the directory containing user interface files.
Clone the additional UI from our GitHub repository. We highly recommended
placing the additional UI folder in the home directory.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_ui_sample_relay.git
```

## Configure the nginx service

The next step is to create the configuration file for the HTTP service. The file
contains the path to the UI folder and the port number on which the UI will be
available.

Create a new configuration file based on the default Leo UI configuration file.
You can use the cp command to clone the file inside the
`/etc/nginx/sites-available` folder. The operation need to be done as a 'root'
user.

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo cp leo_ui leo_ui_sample
```

The nginx service is searching for the configuration file in
`/etc/nginx/sites-enable`. To make nginx load your configuration at start, you
need to add a symbolic link in the sites-enabled folder, pointing to the
configuration file in sites-available folder.

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/leo_ui_sample /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

In case of creating the custom configuration, you must change settings in the
cloned file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available`. Use the `nano` text editor to
make some changes. Don't forget to open the file as the root user.

```bash
sudo nano leo_ui_sample
```

There are two params to change, the port number and the path to the root
website's directory. Make changes according to the code block below.

Chose a port not assigned to any other running service

- `listen 80 default_server;` ==> `listen 90 default_server;`
- `listen [::]:80 default_server;` ==> `listen [::]:90 default_server;`
- `root /opt/leo_ui;` ==> `root /home/pi/leo_ui_sample_relay;`

Save the file - **Ctrl+O**

Close the text editor - **Ctrl+X**

At the end of the whole process, an nginx service restart is needed. It will
make the new interface available.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
