  Detailed tutorial on integrating a generic relay module with your Leo Rover,
  including wiring, firmware updates, and launching a new UI
---

:::warning

This integration is not compatible with Leo Rover v1.8. It is kept on site for
legacy purposes.

:::

This tutorial will show you how to connect a generic relay module, flash
specific firmware, and launch the additional user's interface.

## Prerequisites

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/ssh" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/connect-to-network" />

## Items needed

- Leo Rover
- 1-4 channels relay module
- IDC plug 2x3
- a ribbon cable (6 core)

## Connect the module

In case of powering and controlling a relay module, we highly recommend using
the hSense1 port.

:::info

By default hSense2 and hSense3 are reserved for a GPS and an IMU module.

:::

Connect the relay board to the hSens1 port using the IDC plug. Pins 1-4 are
dedicated for signals, pin 5 is +5V and the last one is GND.

| hSense pin | IMU pin |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 1          | CH1     |
| 2          | CH2     |
| 3          | CH3     |
| 4          | CH4     |
| 5          | +5V     |
| 6          | GND     |

## Flash the dedicated firmware

We developed a version of the
[leo_firmware](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_firmware) with added features for
controlling the relays.

Make sure you have the `git` tool installed on your system, then clone firmware
repository to any folder on your computer and change the branch to
`feature/relay`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_firmware.git
cd leo_firmware
git checkout feature/relay
```

Now, you need to build the firmware and flash it to the Rover. For instructions
on how to do it, please follow the Firmware update tutorial:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/firmware-update" />

Restart the `leo` service to be sure that new topics are registered properly.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

## Configure the additional UI

The first step of adding the new interface is to clone UI's repository from
GitHub to the home directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_ui_sample_relay.git
```

In case of launching the additional UI reconfiguration of the nginx service is
needed. Follow the tutorial below:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/integrations/legacy/additional-ui" />

## Launch the additional UI

The new interface is available on port 90. To launch it in your WEB browser just
type LeoRover's IP address colon port number.

```
http://10.0.0.1:90
```
