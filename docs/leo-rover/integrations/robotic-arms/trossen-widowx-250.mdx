In this tutorial, we will show you how to integrate and remotely control the
Trossen Robotics' WidowX 250 robotic arm.

With 6 degrees of freedom and reach of 650mm WidowX 250 robotic arm is the
biggest, and the most capable, robot arm we have ever tried to stick onto a Leo
Rover.

:::tip

To make integration easier we highly recommend to make use of Powerbox addon

<Powerbox />

:::

## What to expect?

After finishing the tutorial you'll be able to control the arm with a joystick
and Python API, visualize the arms model and plan its moving trajectory with ROS
MoveIt.

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

## Mechanical integration

The mounting of the arm is particularly easy. If you have bought the arm with
the modified support plate designed for our robot, you can use screws and nuts
to connect the arm to the rover's mounting plate.

If you have the original support plate, you can get the model for 3D printing
here (**addons** section):

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/integrations/addon-adapters" />

## Wiring and electronics connection

Stick the Dynamixel cable coming out of the base of the arm into the power
distribution board.

Connect U2D2 and the power distribution board with the short Dynamixel cable.

Connect the U2D2 to the rover using an USB cable

The last step is to stick connect the barrel jack cable to the battery power
supply ([Powerbox addon](/leo-rover/addons/powerbox) might be useful here) and
plug into the other end into power distribution board.

## Software integration

### Integrating the arm with the system

:::info

There is a couple of files that will need to be modified on the Rover's system.
We will show you how to do this using `nano` - a command line text editor, but
if you have your own preferable method of editing files, feel free to use it.

:::

We need to make sure the U2D2 device is available at a fixed path on rover's
system. To do this, you can add a rule to `udev`. Open a new `.rules` file with
`nano`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/u2d2.rules
```

and paste the following rule:

```bash
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6014", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1", ATTR{device/latency_timer}="1", SYMLINK+="ttyDXL"
```

To save the file, type **Ctrl+O** and **Enter** to confirm. Type **Ctrl+X** to
exit nano.

For the rule to take effect, reboot the system or just type:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

The device should now be available under `/dev/ttyDXL` path. You can check it by
typing:

```bash
ls -l /dev/ttyDXL
```

To integrate the arm, you will need to build some additional ROS packages. Start
by creating a local catkin workspace, if you don't have one yet:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src
cd ~/ros_wscatkin
config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}
```

The package sources for the arm are available on Github at the
[interbotix_ros_arms](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_arms)
repository. Clone the repository to your source space:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_arms.git
```

On the rover, you will only need the driver node for the arm (`interbotix_sdk`
package) and the URDF description (`interbotix_descriptions` package). To speed
up the building process, remove the unwanted packages:

```bash
mv interbotix_ros_arms/interbotix_descriptions ./
mv interbotix_ros_arms/interbotix_sdk ./
rm -rf interbotix_ros_arms
```

Now, use `rosdep` to install any dependent packages:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src -iry
```

and build the workspace:

```bash
catkin build -j 1
```

Once the packages have been built, you can edit the environmental setup file to
point to your result space. Open the file in `nano`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ros/setup.bash
```

Comment out the first line by adding `#` sign and add the source command for
your workspace. The first 2 lines should look essentially like this:

```bash
# source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
source /home/pi/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

Now, to add the arm's driver to the rover's launch file, open the `robot.launch`
file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ros/robot.launch
```

and paste these lines somewhere between the `<launch>` tags:

```xml
<include file="$(find interbotix_sdk)/launch/arm_run.launch">
	<arg name="port"                        value="/dev/ttyDXL"/>
	<arg name="robot_name"                  value="wx250"/>
	<arg name="use_default_rviz"            value="false"/>
	<arg name="use_world_frame"             value="false"/>
	<arg name="use_moveit"                  value="true"/>
	<arg name="arm_operating_mode"          value="position"/>
	<arg name="arm_profile_velocity"        value="131"/>
	<arg name="arm_profile_acceleration"    value="15"/>
	<arg name="gripper_operating_mode"      value="position"/>
	<arg name="use_time_based_profile"      value="false"/>
</include>
```

:::info

You can learn more about the driver's parameters and functionalities at the
[interbotix_sdk README page](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_arms/tree/master/interbotix_sdk).

:::

You can also edit the robot's URDF file to connect the arm's base link to the
rover's model. To do this, open the `robot.urdf.xacro` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro
```

and paste these lines somewhere between the `<robot>` tags:

```xml
<link name="wx250/base_link"/>

<joint name="arm_joint" type="fixed">
  <origin xyz="0.043 0 -0.001"/>
  <parent link="base_link"/>
  <child link="wx250/base_link"/>
</joint>
```

:::info

To learn more about what the files under /etc/ros are used for and how do they
correlate with each other, visit the **Adding additional functionality to the
rover** section on **ROS Development** guide:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

:::

That's it! On the next boot, the arm driver node will start together with all
the other nodes. You can manually restart the running nodes by typing:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

## Examples

### Controlling the arm

Now that you have the driver running, you should see the new ROS topics and
services under the `/wx250` namespace. For a full description of the ROS API,
visit the
[interbotix_sdk README page](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_arms/tree/master/interbotix_sdk).
You can test some of the features with the `rostopic` and `rosservice`
command-line tools:

Retrieve the information about the arm:

```bash
rosservice call /wx250/get_robot_info
```

Publish position command to the elbow joint:

```bash
rostopic pub /wx250/single_joint/command interbotix_sdk/SingleCommand "{joint_name: elbow, cmd: -0.5}"
```

Turn off the torque on all joints:

```bash
rosservice call /wx250/torque_joints_off
```

The [interbotix_ros_arms](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_arms)
repository contains some packages that will let you control the arm in different
ways. To use them on your computer, you will need to have ROS installed:

<LinkButton
  to="/leo-rover/advanced-guides/install-ros-on-your-computer"
  title="Install ROS on your computer"
/>

and properly configured to communicate with the nodes running on the rover. For
this, you can visit **Connecting other computer to ROS network** section of the
**ROS Development** tutorial:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

First, install some prerequisites:

```bash
sudo apt install python-catkin-tools
sudo -H pip install modern_robotics
```

:::note

The `modern_robotics` python package is required to run the joystick control
example.

:::

and create a catkin workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src
cd ~/ros_ws
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}
```

Clone the `interbotix_ros_arms` and `leo_description` repositories into the
source space:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_arms.git -b melodic
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_description.git
```

Install dependencies using the `rosdep` tool:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src -iy
```

and build the workspace:

```bash
catkin build
```

Now, `source` the devel space to make the new packages visible in your shell
environment:

```bash
source ~/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

:::info

You will have to do this at every terminal session you want to use the packages
on, so it is convenient to add this line to the `~/.bashrc` file.

### Visualizing the model

- Open RViz by typing `rviz` in the terminal.
- Choose `base_link` as the **Fixed Frame**

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/guides/rviz/rviz-base-link.webp"
  alt="Set fixed frame to base_link in Rviz"
  width="1365"
  height="728"
/>

- On the **Displays** panel, click on **Add** and choose **RobotModel**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/guides/rviz/rviz-add-robot-model.webp"
  alt="Add RobotModel to Display"
  width="1364"
  height="728"
/>

- For the **Robot Description** parameter, choose `robot_description`.

<ImageZoom

  alt="Changing robot description in Rviz"
  width="1362"
  height="729"
/>

- Add another **RobotModel** display, but for the **Robot Description**
  parameter choose `wx250/robot_description`.

  alt="Adding WidowX 250 to Leo Rover model in Rviz"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

The effect should look similar to this:

  height="628"
/>

### Planning the trajectory with MoveIt

MoveIt motion planning framework will allow us to plan and execute a
collision-free trajectory to the destination pose of the end-effector. To use
it, first make sure you have the `use_moveit` parameter for the arm driver set
to `true`:

```xml title="/etc/ros/robot.launch"
<arg name="use_moveit" value="true"/>
```

On your computer, type:

```bash
roslaunch interbotix_moveit interbotix_moveit.launch robot_name:=wx250 rviz_frame:=wx250/base_link
```

The MoveIt GUI should appear:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-ui.webp"
  alt="User interface of MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="791"
/>

On the **MotionPlanning** panel, click on the **Planning** tab, choose
`interbotix_arm` for the **Planning Group** and `<current>` for the **Start
State** (to operate with the gripper, change the **Planning Group** to
`interbotix_gripper`)

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-motion-planning.webp"
  alt="Motion Planning tab of MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

There are some predefined poses which you can choose for the **Goal State**,
such as `home`, `sleep` or `upright`.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-goal-state.webp"
  alt="Setting Goal States in MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

To set the pose manually, navigate to the **Displays panel** ->
**MotionPlanning** -> **Planning Request** and check `Query Goal State`. You
should now be able to manually set the end-effector pose for the goal state.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-displays.webp"
  alt="Setting custom goal states in MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

When the goal state is set, click on the **Plan** button to plan the trajectory
(the simulated trajectory visualization should appear) and **Execute** to send
the trajectory to the driver.

/>

If you want to use the MoveIt capabilities in a Python script or a C++ program,
please look at the
[interbotix_moveit_interface](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_toolboxes/tree/main/interbotix_common_toolbox/interbotix_moveit_interface)
example.

### Using joystick to control the arm

The `interbotix_joy_control` example package provides the capability to control
the movement of the arm (utilizing inverse kinematics) with a PS3, PS4 or an
Xbox 360 joystick.

To use the package with the arm connected to your rover:

- Change the parameters for the driver node. The joy control node uses the `pwm`
  mode for the gripper and is more suited to work with the Time-Based-Profile.
  Here are the settings that work well:

```xml title="/etc/ros/robot.launch"
<arg name="arm_operating_mode"          value="position"/>
<arg name="arm_profile_velocity"        value="200"/>
<arg name="arm_profile_acceleration"    value="200"/>
<arg name="gripper_operating_mode"      value="pwm"/>
<arg name="use_time_based_profile"      value="true"/>
```

- Connect the joystick to your computer. .
- Start the joy_control.launch file:

```bash
roslaunch interbotix_joy_control joy_control.launch robot_name:=wx250 controller:=ps3 arm_run:=false
```

- Change controller to either `ps3`, `ps4` or `xbox360` depending on the
  joystick you have connected.

:::info

You can find the instructions on the package's
[README file](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_arms/blob/master/interbotix_examples/interbotix_joy_control/README.md)
page.

:::

### Using the Python API

Aside from the driver, the `interbotix_sdk` package also provides a Python API
for manipulating the arm. It is designed to mainly work with the `position` mode
for the arm, `pwm` mode for the gripper and the Time-Based-Profile. For a start,
you can set the same parameters for the driver as in the previous example.

There are some example scripts that demonstrate the use of the API at the
`interbotix_examples/python_demos` directory.

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src/interbotix_ros_arms/interbotix_examples/python_demos
```

The `bartender.py` demo performs some pick, pour and place operations. To run
it, first open the file in a text editor and search for this line:

```python
arm = InterbotixRobot(robot_name="wx250s", mrd=mrd)
```

Change wx250s to wx250 and then type on the terminal:

```bash
python bartender.py
```

:::warning

Make sure that you are not running any other script that takes control of the
arm simultaneously (e.g. the joy control node).

:::

If everything went right, you should see the arm in action.

You can check the other files in the directory for more examples. To view the
available functions in the API and their documentation, take a look at the
[robot_manipulation.py](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_arms/blob/master/interbotix_sdk/src/interbotix_sdk/robot_manipulation.py)
file.
