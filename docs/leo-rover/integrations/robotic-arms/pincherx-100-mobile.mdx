In this tutorial, we will show you how to configure and remotely control Trossen
Robotics' PhantomX PincherX 100 mobile connected to Leo Rover.

PincherX 100 Mobile, with its 4DOF and 300mm reach, is on the smaller side of
robotic arms, however, it's big enough to be used as a nice extension for a Leo
Rover. The following tutorial outlines the basics of how to connect it to the
rover and shows how some ROS packages might be used with it. Robotic arms are
used anywhere from education and factories up to dangerous materials handling
facilities, that's why a range of possibilities emerging from attaching a
robotic arm to the rover is almost endless. We hope that this tutorial will be a
good starting point to use robotic arms in your future projects.

## List of components

- PincherX 100 Mobile robotic arm
- M5x10 Allen head screw x 4
- M3x6 Allen head screw x 4
- Barrel Jack cable (connected to ~12V power supply - e.g. rovers battery)

## Mechanical integration

We've redesigned the base of the arm in order to make it easier to connect it to
the rover.

<ImageZoom

  alt="PincherX 100 mobile mounted on Leo Rover"
  width="1000"
  height="750"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

If you want to print it on your own, you can find the SLT file
[here](/docs/leo-rover/documentation/addon-adapters). After printing, it you'll
need to press 4x M3 heat set inserts into the holes shown below.

<ImageZoom

  alt="Addon adapter for PincherX 100 mobile"
  width="826"
  height="606"
  figStyle={{
    width: 300,
  }}
/>

To replace the stock base with the one you printed, you need to remove all the
screws at the bottom of the arm, gently lift old cover and switch it for a new
one. Remember to stick the Dynamixel cable through the hole in the base. Then,
screw the screws back in place.

Use 4x M5x10 allen head screws to bolt the arm to the mounting plate of the Leo
Rover.

Press U2D2 into the deeper opening; it's going to snap in place and will be held
securely inside.

Using 4x M3x6 allen head screws, bolt the power/communication distribution board
to the base.

If you've bought the arm from our online shop, it will come with the base
already replaced.

## Wiring and electronics connection

Stick the Dynamixel cable coming out of the base of the arm into the power
distribution board.

Connect U2D2 and the power distribution board with the short Dynamixel cable.

Connect the U2D2 to the rover using an USB cable

The last step is to stick connect the barrel jack cable to the battery power
supply ([Powerbox addon](https://www.leorover.tech/shop/powerbox) might be
useful here) and plug into the other end into power distribution board.

With everything connected it should look like this:

  height="1500"
/>

## Software integration

As the installation process of the arm's ROS packages might be difficult, we
have prepared bash script that will guide you through the installation. To
execute it, you need to connect to the rover via ssh (see
[prerequisites](#prerequisites)), and type in the terminal on the rover:

```bash
bash <(wget -O- http://files.fictionlab.pl/utilities/install_interbotix_packages.sh); rm wget-log
```

You will be asked to provide the absolute path to your ROS workspace (if you
don't have one on the rover, check
[this tutorial](/docs/leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development#building-additional-ros-packages)
first). Type it in and confirm with enter.

:::note

Don't worry if you make a typo. After providing the path you will have an
opportunity to check it and correct possible mistakes - there will be a prompt
asking if everything is correct.

:::

:::info

The installation process might take a while (up to 20 minutes), so be patient.

:::

Once the packages have been built, you can edit the environmental setup file to
point to your result space. Open the file in `nano`:

```bash
nano /etc/ros/setup.bash
```

Comment out the first line by adding the `#` sign and add the source command for
your workspace. The first 2 lines should look essentially like this:

```bash
# source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
source /home/pi/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

Different operations on the arm require different modes for the ros_controller.
Instead of changing the package configs, we will make our own config file, and
load it in the launch file. First, make your config file and open it to edit it:

```bash
touch /etc/ros/arm_modes.yaml
nano /etc/ros/arm_modes.yaml
```

Then, paste these lines in the file (**ctrl+shift+V**):

```yaml title="/etc/ros/arm_modes.yaml"
groups:
  arm:
    operating_mode: position
    profile_type: time
    profile_velocity: 131
    profile_acceleration: 25
    torque_enable: true

singles:
  gripper:
    operating_mode: pwm
    profile_type: velocity
    profile_velocity: 131
    profile_acceleration: 15
    torque_enable: true
```

To save and exit the file, you can use respectively **ctrl+O** and **ctrl+X**.

Now, to add the arm's driver to the rover's launch file, open the `robot.launch`
file:

```bash
nano /etc/ros/robot.launch
```

and paste these lines somewhere between the `<launch>` tags:

```xml
<include file="$(find interbotix_xsarm_ros_control)/launch/xsarm_ros_control.launch">
    <arg name="robot_model" value="mobile_px100" />
    <arg name="dof" value="4" />
    <arg name="use_world_frame" value="false" />
    <arg name="mode_configs" value="/etc/ros/arm_modes.yaml" />
</include>
```

You can also edit the robot's URDF file to connect the arm's base link to the
rover's model. To do this, open the `robot.urdf.xacro` file:

```bash
nano /etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro
```

and paste these lines somewhere between the `<robot>` tags:

```xml
<link name="mobile_px100/base_link"/>

<joint name="arm_joint" type="fixed">
  <origin xyz="0.043 0 -0.001"/>
  <parent link="base_link"/>
  <child link="mobile_px100/base_link"/>
</joint>
```

:::info

To learn more about what the files under /etc/ros are used for and how do they
correlate with each other, visit the Adding additional functionality to the
rover section on ROS Development guide:

:::

That's it! On the next boot, the arm driver node will start together with all
the other nodes. You can manually restart the running nodes by typing:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

## Examples

### Controlling the arm

Now that you have the driver running, you should see the new ROS topics and
services under the `/mobile_px100` namespace. For a full description of the ROS
API, visit the
[ROS controllers configuration README page](https://www.trossenrobotics.com/docs/interbotix_xsarms/ros_packages/ros_control.html).
You can test some of the features with the `rostopic` and `rosservice`
command-line tools:

Retrieve the information about the arm (all joints):

```bash
rosservice call /mobile_px100/get_robot_info "{cmd_type: 'group', name: 'all'}"
```

Publish the position command to the elbow joint:

```bash
rostopic pub /mobile_px100/commands/joint_single interbotix_xs_msgs/JointSingleCommand "{name: 'elbow', cmd: 0.0}"
```

Turn off the torque on all joints:

```bash
rosservice call /mobile_px100/torque_enable "{cmd_type: 'group', name: 'all', enable: false}"
```

There are other ways to control the arm, but it's better to use them on your
computer and not the rover. To do so, you need to install the ROS packages on
your computer (you can use the same command that you have used for installing
the packages on the rover), but you need to have a computer with ROS installed
(see [prerequisites](#prerequisites)), ROS workspace and Linux OS.

You also need your computer to be properly configured to communicate with the
nodes running on the rover. For this, you can visit the **Connecting other
computer to ROS network** section of the **ROS Development** tutorial:

<LinkButton
  to="/docs/leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development#connecting-another-computer-to-ros-network"
  description="ROS development / Connecting another computer to ROS network"
/>

It's also useful to have the `leo_description` package installed on your
computer for visualization purposes. To install it, type:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-leo-description
```

### Visualizing the model

- Open RViz by typing `rviz` in the terminal.
- Choose `base_link` as the **Fixed Frame**

  alt="Set fixed frame to base_link in Rviz"
  width="1365"
  height="728"
/>

- On the **Displays** panel, click on **Add** and choose **RobotModel**.

  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/guides/rviz/rviz-add-robot-model.webp"
  alt="Add RobotModel to Display"
  width="1364"
  height="728"
/>

- For the **Robot Description** parameter, choose `robot_description`.

/>

Add another **RobotModel** display, but for the **Robot Description** parameter
choose `mobile_px100/robot_description`.

  height="692"
/>

### Planning the trajectory with MoveIt

MoveIt motion planning framework will allow us to plan and execute a
collision-free trajectory to the destination pose of the end-effector. To use
it, first, make sure that the arm is powered and connected to the rover and that
the `ros_control` node is running on the rover. You can check it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status leo
```

and check logs for the nodes in the `/mobile_px100` namespace. You can also
check the list of running nodes using:

```bash
rosnode list
```

And check if there are nodes in the same namespace listed.

Once you are sure the nodes are running, you can go to your computer and run the
MoveIt. But first, you need to connect your computer to the rover's ROS network
(tutorial linked in previous example). You can check if your computer is
connected with:

```bash
rostopic list
```

If the computer is correctly connected, you will see the list of the topics that
are currently available in the ROS network (all of them are on the rover if you
don't have any node launched on your computer).

To work correctly with the arm, MoveIt requires us to change the loaded arm
mode. We need to load back the default mode. To do so, first, open to the
`robot.launch` file (on the rover):

```bash
nano /etc/ros/robot.launch
```

And comment the line where we specify the path for our mode (replace the line in
the file with the line below):

```xml
<!-- <arg name="mode_configs" value="/etc/ros/arm_modes.yaml" /> -->
```

Now, you just need to restart the running nodes with:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

To run MoveIt with the PincherX 100 Mobile arm, run on your computer:

```bash
roslaunch interbotix_xsarm_moveit xsarm_moveit.launch robot_model:=mobile_px100 use_actual:=false dof:=4 rviz_frame:=base_link use_world_frame:=false
```

The MoveIt GUI should appear:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-ui.webp"
  alt="User interface of MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="791"
/>

On the **MotionPlanning** panel, click on the **Planning** tab, choose
`interbotix_arm` for the **Planning Group** and `<current>` for the **Start
State** (to operate with the gripper, change the **Planning Group** to
`interbotix_gripper`)

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-motion-planning.webp"
  alt="Motion Planning tab of MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

There are some predefined poses which you can choose for the **Goal State**,
such as `home`, `sleep` or `upright` (for the gripper, the poses are `open`,
`closed`, `home`).

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-goal-state.webp"
  alt="Setting Goal States in MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

To set the pose manually, navigate to the **Displays panel** ->
**MotionPlanning** -> **Planning Request** and check `Query Goal State`. You
should now be able to manually set the end-effector pose for the goal state
(only for the whole arm, for the gripper it won't work).

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-displays.webp"
  alt="Setting custom goal states in MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

When the goal state is set, click on the **Plan** button to plan the trajectory
(the simulated trajectory visualization should appear) and **Execute** to send
the trajectory to the driver.

  alt="Planning and executing goal states in MoveIt"
  width="1300"

/>

If you want to use the MoveIt capabilities in a Python script or a C++ program,
please look at the
[interbotix_moveit_interface](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_toolboxes/tree/main/interbotix_common_toolbox/interbotix_moveit_interface)
example.

### Using joystick to control the arm

The `interbotix_xsarm_joy` package provides the capability to control the
movement of the arm (utilizing inverse kinematics) with a PS3, PS4 or an Xbox
360 joystick.

To use the package with the arm connected to your rover:

- Connect the joystick to your computer.
- Start the `joy_control.launch` file:

```bash
roslaunch interbotix_xsarm_joy xsarm_joy.launch launch_driver:=false robot_model:=mobile_px100 controller:=ps
```

- Change controller to either `ps3`, `ps4` or `xbox360` depending on the
  joystick you have connected.

:::info

For operating instructions see the
[Joystick Control README](https://www.trossenrobotics.com/docs/interbotix_xsarms/ros_packages/joystick_control.html)
page.

:::

### Using the Python API

Aside from the previous examples, there is also a Python API for manipulating
the arm. It is designed to mainly work with the `position` mode for the arm,
`pwm` mode for the gripper and the Time-Based-Profile (these are the default
configs in the `interbotix_xsarm_control` package).

There are some example scripts that demonstrate the use of the API in the
`interbotix_ros_manipulators/interbotix_ros_xsarms/examples/python_demos`
directory.

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros_workspace>/src/interbotix_ros_manipulators/interbotix_ros_xsarms/examples/python_demos
```

The `bartender.py` demo performs some pick, pour and place operations. To run
it, first, open the file in a text editor and search for this line:

```python
bot = InterbotixManipulatorXS("wx250s", "arm", "gripper")
```

Change `wx250s` to `mobile_px100` and then, type on the terminal:

```bash
python bartender.py
```

:::warning

Make sure that you are not running any other script that takes control of the
arm simultaneously (e.g. the joy control node).

:::

If everything went right, you should see the arm in action.

You can check the other files in the directory for more examples. To get a
better understanding on how the API can be used and the API documentation, take
a look at
[interbotix_xs_modules](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_toolboxes/tree/main/interbotix_xs_toolbox/interbotix_xs_modules).
