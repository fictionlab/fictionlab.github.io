In this tutorial, we will show you how to integrate and remotely control the
Trossen Robotics' WidowX 250 robotic arm.

With 6 degrees of freedom and reach of 650mm WidowX 250 robotic arm is the
biggest, and the most capable, robot arm we have ever tried to stick onto a Leo
Rover.

:::tip

To make integration easier we highly recommend to make use of Powerbox addon

## What to expect?

After finishing the tutorial you'll be able to control the arm with a joystick
and Python API, visualize the arms model and plan its moving trajectory with ROS
MoveIt.

### Integrating the arm with the system

:::info

There is a couple of files that will need to be modified on the Rover's system.
We will show you how to do this using `nano` - a command line text editor, but
if you have your own preferable method of editing files, feel free to use it.

:::

:::info

There is a way to install all of the software using a
[script prepared by a manufacturer](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/ros_interface/ros1/software_setup.html#raspberry-pi-4b-arm64-architecture).
This script streamlines the installation process, however a lot of non-essential
packages are installed with it and if you want to minimize the amount of disk
space required we recommend following the steps below.

:::

Make sure that your rover is connected to internet. If not follow the guide
below.

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/connect-to-network" />

Update the system to ensure that the newest versions of the packages and
repositories are used:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```

Make sure that your ROS is sourced:

```bash
source /opt/ros/<your_ros_distro>/setup.bash
```

Replace `<your_ros_distro>` with installed ROS distribution (e.g. `noetic`).

Install the essential packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -yq curl git
sudo apt-get install -yq python3-pip
python3 -m pip install modern_robotics
sudo apt-get install -yq python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
```

Create a ROS workspace and clone the repositories:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/pi/interbotix_ws/src
cd /home/pi/interbotix_ws/src
git clone -b ${ROS_DISTRO} https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_core.git
git clone -b ${ROS_DISTRO} https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_manipulators.git
git clone -b ${ROS_DISTRO} https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_toolboxes.git
```

By default Interbotix packages contain a CATKIN_IGNORE file which prevents them
from being built. To build the packages for WidowX250 6DOF, remove the following
CATKIN_IGNORE files:

```bash
rm interbotix_ros_core/interbotix_ros_xseries/CATKIN_IGNORE interbotix_ros_manipulators/interbotix_ros_xsarms/CATKIN_IGNORE interbotix_ros_toolboxes/interbotix_rpi_toolbox/CATKIN_IGNORE interbotix_ros_toolboxes/interbotix_xs_toolbox/CATKIN_IGNORE interbotix_ros_toolboxes/interbotix_common_toolbox/interbotix_moveit_interface/CATKIN_IGNORE
```

We need to make sure the device is available at a fixed path on rover's system.
To do this, you can copy a provided file that will add a rule to `udev`:

```bash
cd interbotix_ros_core/interbotix_ros_xseries/interbotix_xs_sdk
sudo cp 99-interbotix-udev.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

Install ROS dependencies using `rosdep`:

```bash
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
cd /home/pi/interbotix_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

After the dependencies are installed, build the workspace:

```bash
catkin build -j 1
```

Once the packages have been built, you can edit the environmental setup file to
point to your result space. Open the file in `nano`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ros/setup.bash
```

Add below line to this file:

```bash
source /home/pi/interbotix_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

Now, to add the configured arm's driver to the rover's launch file, open the
`robot.launch` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ros/robot.launch
```

and paste these lines somewhere between the `<launch>` tags:

```xml
<include file="$(find interbotix_xsarm_control)/launch/xsarm_control.launch">
      <arg name="robot_model"                 value="wx250s"/>
      <arg name="use_world_frame"             value="false"/>
      <arg name="use_rviz"                    value="false"/>
</include>
```

This will start the arm driver node with the specified parameters on rover
startup.

:::info

You can learn more about the driver's parameters and functionalities at the
[interbotix_xsarm_control documentation](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/ros1_packages/arm_control.html).

:::

You can also edit the robot's URDF file to connect the arm's base link to the
rover's model. To do this, open the `robot.urdf.xacro` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro
```

and paste these lines somewhere between the `<robot>` tags:

```xml
<link name="wx250s/base_link"/>

<joint name="arm_joint" type="fixed">
  <origin xyz="0.043 0 -0.001"/>
  <parent link="base_link"/>
  <child link="wx250s/base_link"/>
</joint>
```

Make sure that the origin coordinates are set correctly to match the arm's
position on the rover.

:::info

To learn more about what the files under /etc/ros are used for and how do they
correlate with each other, visit the **Adding additional functionality to the
rover** section on **ROS Development** guide:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

:::

That's it! On the next boot, the arm driver node will start together with all
the other nodes. You can manually restart the running nodes by typing:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

:::warning

If power to the arm is cut (e.g. when the rover is turned off) all of the arm's
motors will be torqued off. This means that the arm will collapse, so manually
hold the arm or place it in a secure position before turning off the rover.

:::

## Examples

### Controlling the arm

Now that you have the driver running, you should see the new ROS topics and
services under the `/wx250s` namespace. For a full description of the ROS API,
visit the
[manufacturer documentation](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/ros_interface/ros1.html).
You can test some of the features with the `rostopic` and `rosservice`
command-line tools:

Publish position command to the elbow joint:

```bash
rostopic pub /wx250s/commands/joint_single interbotix_xs_msgs/JointSingleCommand "name: 'elbow'
cmd: -0.5"
```

:::warning

Be careful while commanding the arm to move. Be ready to stop publishing the
movement command if the arm moves in an unexpected way.

:::

Turn off the torque on all joints:

```bash
rosservice call /wx250s/torque_enable "{cmd_type: 'group', name: 'all', enable: false}"
```

Turn the torque back on:

```bash
rosservice call /wx250s/torque_enable "{cmd_type: 'group', name: 'all', enable: true}"
```

All of the examples below require Interbotix ROS packages to be installed on
your computer. To do that you can either repeat the steps from the previous
section on your pc or use a
[script provided by the manufacturer](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/ros_interface/ros1/software_setup.html#amd64-architecture).
Here the script is recommended.

Make sure that ROS in installed on your computer:

<LinkButton
  to="/leo-rover/advanced-guides/install-ros-on-your-computer"
  title="Install ROS on your computer"
/>

and properly configured to communicate with the nodes running on the rover. For
this, you can visit **Connecting other computer to ROS network** section of the
**ROS Development** tutorial:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

After the installation `source` the devel space to make the new packages visible
in your shell environment:

```bash
source ~/interbotix_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

:::info

You will have to do this at every terminal session you want to use the packages
on, so it is convenient to add this line to the `~/.bashrc` file.

:::

### Visualizing the model

- Open RViz by typing `rviz` in the terminal.
- Choose `base_link` as the **Fixed Frame**

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/guides/rviz/rviz-base-link.webp"
  alt="Set fixed frame to base_link in Rviz"
  width="1365"
  height="728"
/>

- On the **Displays** panel, click on **Add** and choose **RobotModel**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/guides/rviz/rviz-add-robot-model.webp"
  alt="Add RobotModel to Display"
  width="1364"
  height="728"
/>

- For the **Robot Description** parameter, choose `robot_description`.

  alt="Changing robot description in Rviz"
  width="1362"
  height="729"
/>

- Add another **RobotModel** display, but for the **Robot Description**
  parameter choose `wx250s/robot_description`.

  alt="Adding WidowX 250 to Leo Rover model in Rviz"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

The effect should look similar to this:

  height="628"
/>

:::tip

If the arm is not properly aligned with the rover you can go back to
`/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro` file and adjust the `origin` coordinates of the
`arm_joint`.

:::

### Using joystick to control the arm

The `interbotix_xsarm_joy` package provides the capability to control the
movement of the arm (utilizing inverse kinematics) with a PS3, PS4 or an Xbox
joystick.

To launch the joy controller on your pc (using a ps4 gamepad), type:

```bash
roslaunch interbotix_xsarm_joy xsarm_joy.launch robot_model:=wx250s launch_driver:=false controller:=ps4
```

If you are using a different controller, change the `controller` parameter to
`ps3` or `xbox360`. `xbox360` setting will also work with the Xbox One
controller.

:::info

You can find the button mappings on the
[joystick_control docs page](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/ros1_packages/joystick_control.html).

:::

### Planning the trajectory with MoveIt

MoveIt motion planning framework will allow us to plan and execute a
collision-free trajectory to the destination pose of the end-effector. In order
to use it the arm driver node must be using ros_control, therefore the driver
launch file definition must be changed accordingly. To do this open robot launch
file on the rover:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ros/robot.launch
```

and change the lines added during installation (between the `<launch>` tags):

```xml
<include file="$(find interbotix_xsarm_control)/launch/xsarm_control.launch">
      <arg name="robot_model"                 value="wx250s"/>
      <arg name="use_world_frame"             value="false"/>
      <arg name="use_rviz"                    value="false"/>
</include>
```

to:

```xml
<include file="$(find interbotix_xsarm_moveit)/launch/xsarm_moveit.launch">
      <arg name="robot_model"                 value="wx250s"/>
      <arg name="use_world_frame"             value="false"/>
      <arg name="use_rviz"                    value="false"/>
      <arg name="dof"                         value="6"/>
      <arg name="use_actual"                  value="true"/>
</include>
```

This will make the driver launch alongside with MoveIt and ros_control on
startup. To launch the driver either restart the rover or type:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

:::tip

If you want to try launching MoveIt driver from cli on the rover, you can use
the command below:

```bash
roslaunch interbotix_xsarm_moveit xsarm_moveit.launch robot_model:=wx250s use_world_frame:=false use_moveit_rviz:=false dof:=6 use_actual:=true
```

Just remember to remove (or comment) the arm driver include from autostart (in
`/etc/ros/robot.launch`) and restart leo service (`sudo systemctl restart leo`),
as without doing so two instances of the driver will be launched which may lead
to issues.

:::

To command MoveIt, you can launch rviz from your computer (not the rover):

```bash
ROS_NAMESPACE=wx250s roslaunch interbotix_xsarm_moveit moveit_rviz.launch config:=true rviz_frame:=wx250s/base_link
```

The MoveIt GUI should appear:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-ui.webp"
  alt="User interface of MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="791"
/>

On the **MotionPlanning** panel, click on the **Planning** tab, choose
`interbotix_arm` for the **Planning Group** and `<current>` for the **Start
State** (to operate with the gripper, change the **Planning Group** to
`interbotix_gripper`)

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-motion-planning.webp"
  alt="Motion Planning tab of MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

There are some predefined poses which you can choose for the **Goal State**,
such as `home`, `sleep` or `upright`.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/pincherx-100-mobile/moveit-goal-state.webp"
  alt="Setting Goal States in MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

To set the pose manually, navigate to the **Displays panel** ->
**MotionPlanning** -> **Planning Request** and check `Query Goal State`. You
should now be able to manually set the end-effector pose for the goal state.

  alt="Setting custom goal states in MoveIt"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

When the goal state is set, click on the **Plan** button to plan the trajectory
(the simulated trajectory visualization should appear) and **Execute** to send
the trajectory to the driver.

If you want to use the MoveIt capabilities in a Python script or a C++ program,
please look at the
