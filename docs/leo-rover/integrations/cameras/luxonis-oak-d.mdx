This tutorial will guide you through the process of connecting an Oak-D camera
to your Leo Rover.

OAK-D is the ultimate camera for robotic vision that perceives the world like a
human by combining stereo depth camera and high-resolution color camera with an
on-device Neural Network inferencing and Computer Vision capabilities. It uses
USB-C for both power and USB3 connectivity. In robotics, stereo cameras are
commonly used for mapping the environment, object recognition, 3D scanning and
in many other.

## What to expect?

After completing this tutorial, you will have successfully connected an Oak-D
stereo camera to the Leo Rover in ROS, and you will possess basic knowledge
about the use of stereo cameras.

## List of components

- Oak-D Series Stereo Camera
- Any mounting solution (eg.
  [Universal Camera Mast](/leo-rover/addons/universal-camera-mast))
- USB-A to USB-C wire
- (optional) USB-C to DC power supply

## Mechanical integration

There are multiple use cases for stereo cameras. Since we cannot predict them
all, we cannot design a perfect mount for all of them. That's why we provide a
[Universal Camera Mast](/leo-rover/addons/universal-camera-mast) that can fit a
wide range of projects.

## Wiring and electronics connection

Whether you are using our Universal Camera Mast or your own custom solution,
you'll need to connect the camera to the rover somehow.

The USB port placed on the mounting plate of the rover does not support USB 3.0
that's necessary to run the camera. That's why you'll need to connect the USB-C
wire straight to the USB ports of the rovers built-in Raspberry Pi.

Kacper from our team likes to remove the micro-usb port entirely and run the
wire straight through the newly created hole. This solution, combined with the
use of a cable gland, keeps the MEB box waterproof.

Second common solution involves printing a new cover for the MEB box. Dev cover
found [here](/leo-rover/addons/additional-meb-covers), provides a wide opening
for running wires straight into the MEB. This solution can be extremely useful
in projects that don't need to be waterproof.

/>

If the camera isn't the only thing connected to the rover you might need to
provide an external power connection. [Powerbox](/leo-rover/addons/powerbox)
might come in handy in such situations.

## Software integration

### Installing the packages

Add USB rules to your system:

```bash
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03e7", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/80-movidius.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

Install `depthai-ros` packages(only available in ROS noetic):

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-depthai-ros
```

### Adding camera model

As we want to have the camera model visible with the rover model, we need to
change `robot.urdf.xacro` file in `/etc/ros/urdf` directory. Package
`depthai_descriptions` is installed alongside `depthai-ros` and it contains Oak
camera models and xacro macros that we can easily add.

To include the Oak camera macro add following lines to
`/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro` file:

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro"
<xacro:include filename="$(find depthai_descriptions)/urdf/include/depthai_macro.urdf.xacro"/>

<!-- TODO add correct cam position-->
<xacro:depthai_camera camera_name="oak"
                      camera_model="OAK-D-PRO"
                      base_frame="oak-d_frame"
                      parent="base_link"
                      cam_pos_x="0.0"
                      cam_pos_y="0.0"
                      cam_pos_z="0.0"
                      cam_roll="0.0"
                      cam_pitch="0.0"
                      cam_yaw="0.0"/>
```

This macro contains a lot of parameters that are set to a default Oak-D Pro
camera setup on a rover. You can adjust those parameters to your needs (e.g. if
you have the camera mounted in a different position or you are using a different
camera model).

In the end, your `robot.urdf.xacro` file should look like this:

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<robot xmlns:xacro="http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro"
       name="leo">

  <xacro:include filename="$(find leo_description)/urdf/macros.xacro"/>

  <xacro:leo default_antenna="true"
             rockers_fixed="true"
             footprint_link="true"
	     link_prefix=""
             joint_prefix=""/>

	<xacro:include filename="$(find depthai_descriptions)/urdf/include/depthai_macro.urdf.xacro"/>

  <!-- TODO add correct cam position-->
  <xacro:depthai_camera camera_name="oak"
                        camera_model="OAK-D-PRO"
                        base_frame="oak-d_frame"
                        parent="base_link"
                        cam_pos_x="0.0"
                        cam_pos_y="0.0"
                        cam_pos_z="0.0"
                        cam_roll="0.0"
                        cam_pitch="0.0"
                        cam_yaw="0.0"/>

</robot>
```

### Creating launch and configuration files

To launch the camera you can, create your own launch file, use one of the
example packages from `depthai-ros` package or you can use the provided launch
file which provides basic functionalities such as camera image and point cloud
created from depth data.

In `/etc/ros` create a `.yaml` configuration file. This example contains
configuration for Oak-D Pro point cloud mapping.

```yaml title="/etc/ros/leo_oak_pcl.yaml"
/oak:
  camera_i_nn_type: none
  camera_i_laser_dot_brightness: 1000
  camera_i_enable_imu: true
  camera_i_enable_ir: true

  imu_i_acc_freq: 50
  imu_i_rot_freq: 50
  imu_i_gyro_freq: 50

  rgb_i_fps: 10.0
  rgb_i_resolution: '720P'

  left_i_publish_topic: false
  left_i_fps: 10.0

  right_i_publish_topic: false
  right_i_fps: 10.0

  stereo_i_align_depth: true
  stereo_i_subpixel: true
  stereo_i_stereo_conf_threshold: 110
  stereo_i_enable_brightness_filter: false
  stereo_i_brightness_filter_min_brightness: 1
  stereo_i_brightness_filter_max_brightness: 225
  stereo_i_enable_decimation_filter: true
  stereo_i_publish_right_rect: true
```

Next, also in `/etc/ros` create a launch file that will use the previously added
configuration and will create a `nodelet` manager and appropriate nodelets.
Nodelets are used for communication efficiency.

```xml title="/etc/ros/leo_oak_pcl.launch"
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
    <arg name="name" default="oak" />
    <arg name="params_file" default="/etc/ros/leo_oak_pcl.yaml"/>

    <rosparam file="$(arg params_file)" />
    <node pkg="rosservice" if="$(optenv DEPTHAI_DEBUG 0)" type="rosservice" name="set_log_level" args="call --wait /oak_nodelet_manager/set_logger_level 'ros.depthai_ros_driver' 'debug'" />

    <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="$(arg  name)_nodelet_manager" args="manager" output="screen">
        <remap from="/nodelet_manager/load_nodelet" to="$(arg name)/nodelet_manager/load_nodelet"/>
        <remap from="/nodelet_manager/unload_nodelet" to="$(arg name)/nodelet_manager/unload_nodelet"/>
        <remap from="/nodelet_manager/list" to="$(arg name)/nodelet_manager/list"/>
    </node>

    <node name="$(arg  name)" pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" output="screen" required="true" args="load depthai_ros_driver/Camera $(arg  name)_nodelet_manager"/>

    <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="depth_image_to_rgb_pointcloud"
        args="load depth_image_proc/point_cloud_xyzrgb $(arg  name)_nodelet_manager">
        <param name="queue_size" value="1"/>
        <remap from="rgb/camera_info" to="$(arg name)/rgb/camera_info"/>
        <remap from="rgb/image_rect_color" to="$(arg name)/rgb/image_raw"/>
        <remap from="depth_registered/image_rect" to="$(arg name)/stereo/image_raw"/>
        <remap from="depth_registered/points" to="$(arg name)/points"/>
    </node>
</launch>
```

For more information about oak configuration and usage examples you can check
out the
[depthai-ros github repository](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ros/tree/noetic).

### Launching camera nodes on system startup

Include your launch file in the `robot.launch` file, so that your node will
start at boot.

In `/etc/ros/robot.launch` add this line between `<launch>` tags:

```xml title="/etc/ros/robot.launch"
<include file="/etc/ros/leo_oak_pcl.launch"/>
```

Now your Oak-D camera ROS nodes will start at launch.

## Examples

### Reading and visualizing the data

The topics from camera node should be now visible. You can check them with
`rostopic` tool - topics from your node will have prefix specified by you in the
`camera` ROS argument.

If you have ROS installed on your computer, you can get the camera image with
rqt, and see the robot model with camera attached using rviz.

Before starting any of the programs, make sure you completed the **Connecting
another computer to ROS network** of **ROS development** tutorial:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

Now you can start `rqt`, and from `plugins` -> `visualization` choose
`image view` and then choose your topic.

:::note

Don't worry if the quality is low, and the image is lagging. It is due to
transfer of the data through your rover and computer.

:::

You can also start RViz, and add **robot model** in the **display** view. Chose
also `base_link` as **fixed frame**, and you should see the rover model with
camera attached.

You can also display `tf tree` in rqt, to see if everything is configured
correctly (**plugins** -> **visualization** -> **TF Tree**)

## What next?

Stereo cameras are commonly used in projects involving
[autonomous navigation](/leo-rover/advanced-guides/autonomous-navigation), you
might be interested in a tutorial about it.

They are however, not the only way of teaching a Leo Rover how to move on it's
own. Check out our [line follower](/leo-rover/leo-examples/line-follower)
tutorial if you want to learn more. You can also check our
[Integrations page](/category/integrations) for more instructions.
