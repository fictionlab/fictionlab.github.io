In this tutorial we will present the process of connecting a RealSense camera to
your Leo Rover and integrating it with the system on Intel RealSense D435i
example.

Intel RealSense stereo camera is a type of camera capable of capturing image
from two points at the same time. Using stereo disparity - the difference in
object location as seen by the left and right lenses - cameras like Intel
RealSense are capable of distinguishing the distance of objects from the camera.
This data can then be used to in a wide array of cases. In robotics, stereo
cameras are commonly used for mapping the environment, object recognition, 3D
scanning and in many other.

## What to expect?

Having finished the tutorial you will possess basic knowledge about the use of
stereo cameras with ROS.

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/install-ros-on-your-computer" />

## Mechanical integration

RealSense cameras provide two mounting mechanisms:

- One 1/4-20 UNC thread mounting point.
- Two M3 thread mounting points.

You can use those mechanisms, or print a special plate, and attach camera to it,
and then mount the plate to the Rover.

## Wiring and electronics connection

For connecting the camera to your Rover you can use USB-C cable, as RealSense
has USB-C* 3.1 Gen 1* connector. You need to remove special plate on the back
side of the camera, which covers the USB port, and you are ready to connect the
camera through the USB port on the Rover.

:::note

The USB port on the rover is the USB 2.0 version. This may produce some warnings
when running RealSense ROS nodes, but the camera still works.

:::

## Software integration

### Installing the packages

As ROS `realsense2_camera` package is available as a debian package, we will
install it using `apt`. To do so, connect to the rover via ssh, and type:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-realsense2-camera
```

We want also the description package, which includes 3D models of the device
(those are required for some nodes). To install them type in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-realsense2-description
```

:::info

The version of librealsense2 is almost always behind the one available in
RealSenseâ„¢ official repository, but this way is much easier to install. If you
want to install the newest version, you can follow
[this tutorial](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/blob/development/README.md#installation-instructions).

:::

### Adding camera model

As we want to have the camera model visible with the rover model, we need to
change `robot.urdf.xacro` file in `/etc/ros/urdf` directory. On this site you
can see what RealSense urdf camera models are available in the
`realsense2_description` package. Each of the urdf files there has `xacro macro`
with a lot of properties. You have to include such macro in the
`robot.urdf.xacro` file on the Rover, and change `name` property to avoid tf
frame conflicts. To do so, you need to include such lines:

```xml
<xacro:include filename="$(find realsense2_description)/urdf/_d435i.urdf.xacro"/>

<xacro:sensor_d435i parent="base_link" name="d435i_camera">
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
  </xacro:sensor_d435i>
```

You can specify `name` property to anything you want. We just need to change it,
so we don't have conflicts on `camera_link` tf frame. `Origin` property is for
specifying the position of the camera regarding the link specified in parent
property. So if the `parent` property is set to "base_link", the position in
`origin` property is regarding the origin of the Rover.

In the end, your `robot.urdf.xacro` file should look like this:

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<robot xmlns:xacro="http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro"
       name="leo">

  <xacro:include filename="$(find leo_description)/urdf/macros.xacro"/>
  <xacro:include filename="$(find realsense2_description)/urdf/_d435i.urdf.xacro"/>

  <xacro:leo default_antenna="true"
             rockers_fixed="true"
             footprint_link="true"
	     link_prefix=""
             joint_prefix=""/>

  <xacro:sensor_d435i parent="base_link" name="d435i_camera">
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
  </xacro:sensor_d435i>

</robot>
```

### Launching camera nodes on system startup

To get the image from camera, you need to launch the camera nodes. You can
simply do it by typing in terminal those commands

```bash
source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch camera:=d435i_camera
```

You need to specify the `camera` argument because of the tf frame conflicts. You
have to put the same value as in the `urdf` file.

It's much more comfortable to run this node automatically, as you may sometimes
forget to. To launch it with the system we need to change `robot.launch` file in
`/etc/ros/` directory. You have to include those lines in the file, somewhere
between the `<launch>` tag:

```xml title="/etc/ros/robot.launch"
<include file="$(find realsense2_camera)/launch/rs_camera.launch">
    <arg name="camera" value="d435i_camera"/>
</include>
```

:::warning

Make sure to specify the camera argument to the right value. You need that for
working `camera` model in visualization.

:::

Now, the realsense camera node will be launched with every system startup. You
can also force this start right now with

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

## Examples

### Reading and visualizing the data

The topics from camera node should be now visible. You can check them with
`rostopic` tool - topics from your node will have prefix specified by you in the
camera ROS argument.

If you have ROS installed on your computer, you can get the camera image with
`rqt`, and see the robot model with camera attached using `rviz`.

Before starting RViz or rqt, make sure you completed the **Connecting another
computer to ROS network** section of **ROS Development** tutorial:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

Now you can start `rqt`, and from **plugins** -> **visualization** choose
**image view** and then choose your topic.

:::note

Don't worry if the quality is low, and the image is lagging. It is due to
transfer of the data through your rover and computer.

:::

You can also start RViz, and add **robot model** in the **display** view. Chose
also `base_link` as **fixed frame**, and you should see the rover model with
camera attached.

You can also display `tf tree` in rqt, to see if everything is configured
correctly (**plugins** -> **visualization** -> **TF Tree**)

## What next?

Stereo cameras are commonly used in projects involving
[autonomous navigation](/leo-rover/advanced-guides/autonomous-navigation), you
might be interested in a tutorial about it.

They are however, not the only way of teaching a Leo Rover how to move on it's
own. Check out our [line follower](/leo-rover/leo-examples/line-follower)
tutorial if you want to learn more. You can also check our
[Integrations page](/leo-rover/integrations) for more instructions.
