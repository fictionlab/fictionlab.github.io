  Integrate the ZED camera with your Leo Rover using the ZED ROS wrapper package
  and get data like depth maps and point clouds.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to connect and use ZED camera, on your
rover.

ZED stereo camera is a type of camera capable of capturing image from two points
at the same time. Using stereo disparity - the difference in object location as
seen by the left and right lenses - cameras like ZED are capable of
distinguishing the distance of objects from the camera. This data can then be
used to in a wide array of cases. In robotics, stereo cameras are commonly used
for mapping the environment, object recognition, 3D scanning and in many other.

List of components To complete this tutorial, you need to have
[additional computer](/leo-rover/integrations/computing-devices/nvidia-jetson)
on your rover, which supports **CUDA** operations (for example **NVIDIA
Jetson**), has internet connection, and ROS installed (on your and the rover
computers).

## Mechanical integration

As every ZED camera model has many mounting options and flat bottom, each of the
camera models can be easily integrated with the rover. You can 3D print a
special plate, which you will attach to the rover using mounting holes, and
attach the camera to this plate. Anything that works for you is okay.

## Wiring and electronics connection

To connect ZED camera to your additional computer, you need to have one free USB
slot on the computer, and connect the camera with a USB cable.

## Software integration

### ZED SDK

First, you need to install the ZED SDK on your additional computer. Go to the
[stereolabs page](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/release/) and download
installer version, that corresponds your additional computer, and its
configuration.

Then, open a terminal in a directory where you have downloaded the installer
script and add execution permission to it:

```bash
chmod +x ZED_SDK_<installer version>.run
```

And then, start the installation:

```bash
./ZED_SDK_<installer version>.run
```

At the beginning of the installation, you will be shown the Software License,
just hit **Q** to close it after reading. Next you will be asked for
administrator password, and might have to answer some questions on dependencies,
tools and samples installation. Type `y` for **yes** and `n` for **no** and hit
**Enter** (hitting **Enter** without typing anything chooses default option).

:::info

Remember that you need to have CUDA on your board computer, to use ZED SDK. If
it's not installed, when you run ZED SDK installer, it will ask you, whether
should it be installed during SDK installation. On Jetson computers CUDA is
automatically installed with JetPack, but if you have any problems, try:

```bash
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda
```

:::

### ROS packages

The [ZED ROS wrapper](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper) package
lets you use the ZED stereo cameras with ROS. It provides you data like left and
right `rectified`/`unrectified` images, `depth map`, `3D point cloud` and more.
To install it, go to `src` directory in your ROS workspace on board computer,
and clone the github repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper.git
```

Now you have to install all required dependencies. Assuming you are still in
`src` directory, go to the parent directory (`cd ..`) and type

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
rosdep install --from-paths src -i
```

Now you have to build the packages

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
catkin build
```

:::note

If build somehow fails with error including `CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR`, it means
you don't have CUDA installed. Try

```bash
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda
```

:::

### Running the package

Running the nodes is actually simple, but we want to have the data visible on
other computers connected to the rovers as well. To ensure that, we need to say
where (on what computer) is the ROS master. To do so, first source your ROS
workspace directory

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```

:::note

Path given in this command is relative assuming you are in your ROS workspace
directory.

:::

Now we need to export environment variables before running the node. This way we
will communicate with the correct ROS master. To export the variables, type on
your board computer:

```bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://master.localnet:11311
export ROS_IP=<IP address of your board computer in the rover network>
```

Now you are ready to launch the node

```bash
roslaunch zed_wrapper <your ZED camera model>.launch
```

:::warning

Make sure to provide correct launch file, based by your ZED camera model.
Possible options:

- zed.launch
- zedm.launch
- zed2.launch
- zed2i.launch

:::

Now if everything is fine, you should see on every computer connected to the
rover topics from the ZED node. You can list them (after sourcing ROS workspace)
with

```bash
rostopic list
```

## Examples

### Visualizing the data

With the `zed_wrapper` node running, you can visualize the data from ZED camera
in RViz. To do so, you need to add **camera display** in **displays** section,
and choose the correct `image topic`.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/zed/rviz-camera-display.webp"
  width="1364"
  height="731"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/zed/rviz-camera-topic.webp"
  width="353"
  height="358"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

For the image topic, you can choose anything you want from the options.
Different topics give different images, for example

- `rgb/image_rect_color` gives color rectified image
- `rgb_raw/image_raw_color` gives color unrectified image

You can also choose whether you want the left or right camera sensor (it's
included in the image topic name)

With this setup you can see video image from the ZED camera connected to your
board computer.

:::info

You may occur low quality video, if you try to visualize the camera output like
this (without processing) on other computer connected to the rover (not the one
that is connected to ZED camera with USB cable).

The reason is large size of the data that you are sending. Surely changing
**Transport Hint** (option below camera image) to `compressed` will help a bit,
but won't solve the problem completely

## What next?

Stereo cameras are commonly used in projects involving
[autonomous navigation](/leo-rover/advanced-guides/autonomous-navigation), you
might be interested in a tutorial about it.

They are however, not the only way of teaching a Leo Rover how to move on it's
own. Check out our [line follower](/leo-rover/leo-examples/line-follower)
tutorial if you want to learn more. You can also check our
[Integrations page](/category/integrations) for more instructions.
