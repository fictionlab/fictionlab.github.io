This tutorial will guide you through the process of connecting Fixposition
Vision-RTK 2 to Leo Rover.

Fixposition Vision RTK2 is a great GPS module capable of achieving up-to a
centimeter-level accuracy. This system leverages Real-TimeKinematic (RTK) and
vision-based positioning technology to provide precise localization even in
challenging environments. With its compact design Vision-RTK 2 empowers Leo
Rover users to navigate with unparalleled accuracy, unlocking new possibilities
for research, exploration, and industrial applications.

## List of components

- Fixposition Vision-RTK2
- Power connector
- Adapter plate (eg. the one we provide
  [here](/docs/leo-rover/integrations/addon-adapters#fixposition-vision-rtk2-adapter))

## Mechanical integration

The module needs to be attached to the rover in a spot that provides an
uninterrupted view of the terrain.

The accuracy of the system depends on how far apart the GNSS antennas are
spaced. Since Leo Rover is rather small it might be hard to place them more than
30cm apart. The system provides a satisfactory accuracy with setup like this,
but it's not advised to go even lower. If your project allows it, try to
position the antennas even further apart. It's also a good choice to move the
GNSS antennas away from any parts of the rover that might be a source of
electromagnetic interferences (e.g. motors).

## Wiring and electronics connection

The only wire needed for the module to work is a power cable. An external power
distribution module like our [Powerbox](/docs/leo-rover/addons/powerbox) might
come in handy in this case. Connecting the power wire straight to the rovers
battery is theoretically possible, but not advised.

## Software integration

:::info

Before starting the software integration, please make sure that the sensor is
properly configured. It's good to check out the
[integration instruction](https://docs.fixposition.com/fd/integration-manual)
and follow 4th and 5th chapters, as well as the quick starter guide found on the
[product's site](https://www.fixposition.com/products/vision-rtk2-starter-kit)
in the resources section.

In the network configuration part, you need to connect the sensor to the rover's
access point, to establish data flow between Vision RKT-2 and the Leo robot.

It's also worth to remember the sensor's IP address at this point, as it's
clearly visible in the fixposition's web UI.

:::

Having configured the sensor, and connected to the rover, the only thing that we
need to do is integrate the sensor's data into ROS system running on the rover.

For this task we need to install the fixposition ROS driver into our ROS
workspace, therefore log in using ssh to the rover, and enter the directory with
package sources in your workspace:

```bash
cd <your_workspace>/src
```

Then download the GitHub repository with the driver:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fixposition/fixposition_driver.git
```

As the repository also contains sources of packages for ROS2 we can remove them:

```bash
cd fixposition_driver
rm -rf *ros2
```

Now we need to build the package, so go back to the ROS workspace and execute
those commands:

```bash
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src -iry
catkin build
```

Once the packages are installed, we need to do some configuration for the driver
to work properly. First we have to change the `ip` parameter in the `tcp.yaml`
file to the sensor's IP address in the rover network, so it should look like
this:

```yaml title="fixposition_driver/fixposition_driver_ros1/launch/tcp.yaml"
ip: '10.0.0.137'
```

As we are going to provide wheel odometry data for the sensor from our robot, we
have to configure also the odometry converter. In the`odom_converter.yaml` file
we have to put the correct topic type and name and chose to use the angular data
from the topic too. We will use the`/odometry_merged` topic of type `Odometry`
with the angular data, therefore the parameters will be:

```yaml title="fixposition_driver/fixposition_odometry_converter/launch/odom_converter.yaml"
topic_type: 'Odometry'
input_topic: '/odometry_merged'
use_angular: true
```

:::warning

If your robot has some namespace different than `/`, you need to provide the
`input_topic` param with the namespace. Just make sure that the provided topic
name is in the global namespace - starting with `/`, so it's in a form
`/namespace/odometry_merged`.

:::

Now, the last part of the configuration is to include the correct launch file in
the main launch file. As the sensor is connected with the rover through Wi-Fi,
we need to launch the TCP related files. Therefore you need to comment and
uncomment correct lines in `driver_with_odom_converter.launch` file. It should
look like this:

```xml title="fixposition_driver/fixposition_driver_ros1/launch/driver_with_odom_converter.launch"
<launch>
    <!-- Select TCP or Serial Accordingly  -->
    <!-- <include file="$(find fixposition_driver_ros1)/launch/serial.launch"/> -->
    <include file="$(find fixposition_driver_ros1)/launch/tcp.launch"/>
    <include file="$(find fixposition_odometry_converter)/launch/odom_converter.launch"/>
</launch>
```

With such setup it is okay to launch the nodes, but we need to enable the data
flow from the sensor, therefore you need to enable couple of options in the
Input/output part of the fixposition webUI. To be more specific, you must enable
those options on some `TCP` port (e.g., `TCP0`):

- FP_A-ODOMETRY
- FP_A-LLH
- NOV_B-BESTGNSSPOS_GNSS (both)
- FP_A-RAWIMU
- FP_A-CORRIMU
- FP_A-TF_POIVRTK
- FP_A-TF_VRTKCAM

:::info

You can read more about each option in the Vision RTK-2 integration
instructions.

The options are also described in the repository
[README.md](https://github.com/fixposition/fixposition_driver/tree/main) file,
with purpose and ROS message format.

:::

Now it's also convenient to launch this node at the robot's start-up so we don't
have to do this manually. There is also one problem with `tf` frames published
by the fixposition ROS driver - at this point it's not connected to Leo's
`tf tree`.

To connect the frames, we will use static transform publisher, which needs to be
launched every time with the driver. Therefore, we will make one launch file and
cover both functionalities in it. Usual location for such files is `/etc/ros`
directory and we will place the file there.

```xml title="/etc/ros/fixposition.launch"
<launch>
    <include file="$(find fixposition_driver_ros1)/launch/driver_with_odom_converter.launch"/>
    <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="fixposition_broadcaster" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 base_link FP_POI 100"/>
</launch>
```

And we must include it inside the main launch file on the robot (add this line
somewhere in between the `launch` tag):

```xml title="/etc/ros/robot.launch"
<include file="/etc/ros/fixposition.launch"/>
```

:::info

The transformation specified in the static transform publisher node requires the
Vision RTK-2 to be mounted directly above the base_link frame. In case of a
different mounting position, you need to specify the correct transform in the
launch file.
