This tutorial will guide you through the process of connecting a UBlox GPS
module to your Leo Rover.

EVK-7 / EVK-8 / EVK-M8 evaluation kits make evaluating the high performance
u-blox 7, u-blox 8 and u-blox M8 positioning products simple. The built-in USB
interface provides both power supply and high-speed data transfer, and
eliminates the need for an external power supply. The u-blox evaluation kits are
compact, and their user-friendly interface and power supply make them ideally
suited for use in laboratories, vehicles and outdoor locations.

In this tutorial we will present the process of connecting a UBlox GPS module to
your Leo Rover and integrating it with the system on the **UBlox EVK-M8N GPS
module** example.

The steps might slightly differ for other UBlox models, but should be
essentially similar.

## What to expect?

After completing this tutorial, you should be able to gather the GPS data and
get it published on ROS topics.

## List of components

- UBlox GPS module (we have used the **UBlox EVK-M8N GPS module**)
- Any computer which you can connect to the rover via ssh.

## Mechanical integration

When it comes to mounting the module, any solution that works for you is okay.
You can 3D print a special mounting plate, use a velcro or even a tape.

## Wiring and electronics connection

Wiring up the module is very simple, as it doesn't require external power
supply. You just need to connect the module with a USB cable with the rover via
the USB socket in the mounting plate. There is a micro-usb mounting hole with
the USB sign on the module, and you need to plug in the USB cable there.

## Software integration

The first thing you can do is to make sure your device has the correct
permissions and is available at the fixed path on your system. To do this, you
can add the following rule to the `udev` service. We will need `idVendor` and
`idProduct`, to make the rules for the correct device. To get that information,
you need to connect to the rover via `ssh`, and then, you can use the `lsusb`
command. It will list all connected usb devices. In the output, you should look
for something named like **U-Blox AG [u-blox 8]**:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/ublox-gps/terminal-lsusb.webp"
  width="587"
  height="112"
/>

Now, our `idVendor` and `idProduct` are the two strings after "ID" divided by
colon. In our case, `idVendor` is `1546` and `idProduct` is `01a8`.

After getting those two, the only thing that is left is the port that the device
connects to. You can get it by running in the terminal the command:

```bash
dmesg -w
```

and then connecting the module to the rover. You should see that the new device
is registered, and on what port (with this command, you can also get the
`idVendor` and `idProduct` values).

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/ublox-gps/terminal-ttyacm0.webp"
  width="867"
  height="112"
/>

Now, you need to make a `udev` rules file.

```xml title="/etc/udev/rules.d/ublox.rules"
KERNEL=="ttyACM*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1546", ATTRS{idProduct}=="01a8", MODE="0666", GROUP="dialout", SYMLINK+="ublox_gps"
```

Paste these lines to `/etc/udev/rules.d/ublox.rules` file and reload `udev`
rules by typing:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

Your device should now be available at the `/dev/ublox_gps` path.

We want the sensor functionality to be available in the ROS ecosystem, so you
should install a ROS package that provides a node for the sensor you are trying
to integrate.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-ublox
```

Now, create a launch file that would start the node with a fitting
configuration.

```xml title="/etc/ros/gps.launch"
<launch>
  <node name="ublox_gps_node" pkg="ublox_gps" type="ublox_gps" clear_params="true" output="screen">
    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find ublox_gps)/config/nmea.yaml"/>
    <param name="device" value="/dev/ublox_gps"/>
    <param name="frame_id" value="ublox_frame"/>
  </node>
</launch>
```

Include your launch file in the `robot.launch` file (somewhere between
`<launch>` tags), so that your node will start at boot.

In `/etc/ros/robot.launch`:

```xml
<include file="/etc/ros/gps.launch"/>
```

Your robot should be aware of where the module is located and what space it
occupies. You can ensure it does that by creating a URDF model of the module.

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/ublox.urdf.xacro"
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot>
	<link name="ublox_frame"/>

  <joint name="ublox_joint" type="fixed">
    <origin xyz="-0.05 0 0"/>
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="ublox_frame"/>
  </joint>

</robot>
```

:::warning

Make sure that "frame_id" param in the launch file and "link name" in
ublox.urdf.xacro file have the same value.

:::

And including it in the description that is uploaded at boot.

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro"
<xacro:include filename="/etc/ros/urdf/ublox.urdf.xacro"/>
```

The last step is to either reboot the robot

```bash
reboot
```

or restart the `leo` service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

## Examples

### Checking the GPS module accuracy

Type this command into the console to check the data sent by GPS module:

```bash
rostopic echo /ublox_gps_node/fix
```

You should see a lot of data flowing through the topic. Stop the data
acquisition with **Ctrl+C** and have a look on a usual data frame.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/ublox-gps/ech-ublox-gps-node.webp"
  width="1019"
  height="317"
/>

Using Google Maps you can easily evaluate the precision of your GPS module. Find
the latitude and longitude data in the data frames send by the module. Copy and
paste it into google maps search bar. When a pin appears, you should be able to
see where the module thinks it is.

:::note

Usually accuracy is off by some factor. Depending on the amount of interferences
and the quality of the GPS module, the difference between real location and the
position gathered with GPS module may vary.

:::

Right click on the map location you believe you are at and use "Measure
distance" option at the bottom of the list. Then, create another spot for the
distance measuring tool right where the red marker is. Google will then do the
math and show you the distance between your real location and where the GPS
module thinks it is.

### Data visualization with Mapviz

Using [Mapviz](http://wiki.ros.org/mapviz) - a package similar to RViz, yet
focused on visualization of 2D data - you can easily visualize the data gathered
by the GPS module. Installing the package boils down to using this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-mapviz ros-$ROS_DISTRO-mapviz-plugins ros-$ROS_DISTRO-tile-map ros-$ROS_DISTRO-multires-image
```

Since Mapviz is a program using GUI you may want to connect to the Leo Rover via
remote desktop. Follow this tutorial if you want to learn how:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/remote-desktop" />

Launch Mapviz with:

```bash
roslaunch mapviz mapviz.launch
```

You'll be greeted by a blank screen with configuration window on the left. Using
the **Add** button on the bottom of this window add **tile_map** and **navsat**
plugins. Change the source of **tile_map** to `Stamen (terrain)` (Or any other
available option) and the topic of **navsat** to the topic your GPS module is
publishing data to (for us it's `/ublox_gps_node/fix`).

  figStyle={{
    width: 350,
  }}
/>

:::warning

Make sure the tile_map plugin is listed first and navsat second. Otherwise,
points created by navsat will be hidden behind the map tiles.

:::

From now on, a dot will appear on the map every time your GPS module publishes
data at the topic you chose.

## What next?

GPS modules are commonly used in projects involving outside autonomous
navigation. As of right now, we have no tutorials on such a thing, however, our
tutorial on indoor
[autonomous navigation](/leo-rover/advanced-guides/autonomous-navigation) you
might be something you'll be interested in.

You can also check our [Integrations page](/category/integrations) for other
instructions.
