This tutorial will guide you through the process of connecting and using
Velodyne Puck LiDAR sensor on your rover.

Light Detection and Ranging devices, or Lidars for short, are mechanisms used
for mapping the environment, object detection, tracking the speed of vehicles
and in a wide range of other applications. The VLP-16 has a range of 100 m, and
the sensor's low power consumption (~8 W), light weight (830 g), compact
footprint (~Ã˜103 mm x 72 mm), and dual return capability make it ideal not only
for autonomous vehicles but also robotics and mobile terrestrial 3D mapping
applications.

## What to expect?

After finishing the tutorial you will have configured the Velodyne Puck LiDAR to
work on your rover. You will be able to gather and visualize the data from the
sensor.

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

## Mechanical integration

It's common for 3D lidars to be attached some distance above the mounting plate
of a robot. This procedure allows you to avoid the need to filter data related
to the reflection of the laser beam from the robot's elements.

The easiest solution for attaching the Velodyne Puck above the mounting plate of
a Leo Rover would be using our
[Universal Camera Mast](/leo-rover/addons/universal-camera-mast).

<CameraMast />

However, you can also design a custom eg. like the one shown in the picture
below.

  }}
/>

## Wiring and electronics connection

Whatever your mounting solution might be, You'll still have to connect the lidar
to the rover somehow.

The USB port placed on the mounting plate of the rover is not going to be
enough. In order for the Lidar to work You'll have to provide an ethernet
connection between it, and the rover.

Kacper from our team likes to remove the micro-usb port entirely and run the
wire straight through the newly created hole. This solution, combined with the
use of a cable gland, keeps the MEB box waterproof.

Second common solution involves printing a new cover for the MEB box. Dev cover
found [here](/leo-rover/addons/additional-meb-covers), provides a wide opening
for running wires straight into the MEB. This solution can be extremely useful
in projects that don't need to be waterproof.

  }}
/>

If the camera isn't the only thing connected to the rover you might need to
provide an external power connection. [Powerbox](/leo-rover/addons/powerbox)
might come in handy in such situations.

## Software integration

### Configuring the sensor for the rover

In this section Velodyne Puck will be connected to a PC in order to modify its
configuration for the rover. These instructions will contain setup on a PC with
Ubuntu. If you are looking to connect to the sensor on Windows you can checkout
[VLP-16 User Manual](https://velodynelidar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/63-9243-Rev-E-VLP-16-User-Manual.pdf)
(chapters 4.1.2 and 4.2.2).

:::info

If in this part you encounter problems you can try turning off your WiFi.

:::

Power the LiDAR via the included adapter and connect the sensor to an ethernet
port on your computer.

Go to the **Network** tab in settings and enter **Wired** settings.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/velodyne-puck/network-settings.webp"
  width="973"
  height="801"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

In the wired settings go to IPv4 tab, choose manual IPv4 method, type in the IP
for your computer (in this tutorial this IP will be `192.168.1.100` however you
can choose any IP in that network that is not sensor's IP), add a
`255.255.255.0` Netmask and then click **Apply**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/velodyne-puck/wired-ip-addresses.webp"
  width="576"
  height="348"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

Open the terminal and add a static route do the sensor's IP address - by default
it should be `192.168.1.201`. Replace `eth0` with your ethernet interface
signature - you can find this using `ifconfig` command.

```bash
sudo route add 192.168.1.201 eth0
```

Now you should be able to connect to the sensor. You can check the connection by
pinging the LiDAR.

```bash
ping 192.168.1.201
```

Open your browser and type in the sensor's IP address (`192.168.1.201`). The
following page should appear:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/velodyne-puck/vlp-16-user-interface.webp"
  width="1176"
  height="840"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

In these settings scroll down and in **Host (Destination)** section change IP
Address to `10.0.0.1` and click **Set**. In **Network (Sensor)** section change
**DHCP** to `On` and click **Set**. Finally click **Save Configuration** button.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/velodyne-puck/vlp-16-user-interface-2.webp"
  width="802"
  height="606"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

For a better understanding of what each option does you can use
[VLP-16 User Manual](https://velodynelidar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/63-9243-Rev-E-VLP-16-User-Manual.pdf).

You can now disconnect and power down the sensor. After it's next booted up
these changes will persist.

### Setting up the Velodyne sensor on the rover

Power the LiDAR via the adapter and connect in to the ethernet port on the
rover's Raspberry Pi.

Now the sensor will get an IP assigned by rover's DHCP server. You can check
this IP by installing and using `nmap`.

```bash
sudo apt install nmap
nmap 10.0.0.1/24
```

In output there will also be the address of Raspberry Pi and other devices
connected to the rover such as your computer, however other connections should
have distinctive names, such as leo (`10.0.0.1`).

To make sure that the sensor is connected you can type its IP address (the one
from `nmap` result) into the browser and you should see the VLP-16 User
Interface - the same as in the previous configuration.

:::note

From now on remember to use this new IP if sensor's IP is needed in any of the
other modules.

:::

### ROS software installation

Make sure that system date is correct by writing this command in the terminal.

```bash
date
```

If the date is not correct you can set it to current date. Replace
`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` with current date and time e.g. `2023-01-31 09:00:00`.

```bash
sudo date -s 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
```

Next make sure that all your packages are up to date.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

Now you can install Velodyne ROS package. Replace `ROSDISTRO` with your ROS
version e.g. `noetic`.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-ROSDISTRO-velodyne
```

If you haven't already, setup a ROS workspace.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src
cd ~/ros_ws
catkin init
```

Go to the src directory in your workspace and clone a repository with Velodyne
Driver.

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne.git
```

Go back to main workspace directory and install ROS dependencies. Replace
ROSDISTRO with your ROS version e.g. noetic.

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro ROSDISTRO -y
```

You can now build your workspace.

```bash
catkin build --make-args -j2
```

### Adding Velodyne puck to URDF

Your robot should be aware of where the scanner is located and what space it
occupies. You can ensure it does that by creating an URDF model file of the
sensor in `/etc/ros/urdf` directory.

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/laser.urdf.xacro"
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot>
    <link name="velodyne_base_link">
      <visual>
        <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0.03585"/>
        <geometry>
          <cylinder radius="0.0516" length="0.0717"/>
        </geometry>
      </visual>
      <collision>
        <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0.03585"/>
        <geometry>
          <cylinder radius="0.0516" length="0.0717"/>
        </geometry>
      </collision>
    </link>

    <link name="velodyne">
      <inertial>
        <mass value="0.1"/>
        <origin xyz="0 0 0"/>
        <inertia ixx="0.1" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyy="0.1" iyz="0" izz="0.1"/>
      </inertial>
    </link>

    <joint name="velodyne_base_mount_joint" type="fixed">
      <origin xyz="0.0775 0 0"/> <!-- TODO after sensor is mounted -->
      <parent link="base_link"/>
      <child link="velodyne_base_link"/>
    </joint>

    <joint name="velodyne_base_scan_joint" type="fixed" >
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.0377" rpy="0 0 0" />
      <parent link="velodyne_base_link" />
      <child link="velodyne"/>
    </joint>
</robot>
```

And including it in the description file that is uploaded at boot.

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro"
<xacro:include filename="/etc/ros/urdf/laser.urdf.xacro"/>
```

:::tip

You can experiment with the URDF file and create a more representative model of
the sensor by adding more visual and collision tags or by including meshes in
STL or COLLADA format.

:::

The last step is to either reboot the robot or restart the leo service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

### Running Velodyne Puck ROS node

To run the node type:

```bash
roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points.launch
```

### Adding the node to autostart

Open `/etc/ros/robot.launch` and add this line inside `<launch> `tag:

```xml
<include file="$(find velodyne_pointcloud)/launch/VLP16_points.launch" />
```

Now you can reboot the robot or restart the leo service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

### Modifying Velodyne Puck configuration to be more power efficient (optional)

If you are not using the LiDAR at all times (its ROS node is not running at all
times) you can use instructions below to prolong battery life. By default
Velodyne Puck turns on its motor and laser on power up which consumes a lot of
battery. However its configuration can be adjusted not to not turn on on power
up and a ROS node can be added to turn the sensor on when needed.

To do that you need to reconfigure Velodyne Puck first.

Enter the configuration site in your web browser by typing sensor's IP.

In the settings turn **laser** `off` and set **motor RPM** to `0`.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/velodyne-puck/vlp-16-0rpm.webp"
  width="802"
  height="608"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/velodyne-puck/vlp-16-save-configuration.webp"
  width="802"
  height="606"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

Next scroll down and click **Save configuration**. Now the motor and laser
should not be running after power up.

Now you can go to your the `velodyne_pointcloud` directory where the scripts
will be added.

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src/velodyne/velodyne_pointcloud/scripts
```

In this directory create `config_velodyne.sh` and `velodyne_config_manager.py`
and copy the code below into them.

```bash title="/ros_ws/src/velodyne/velodyne_pointcloud/scripts/config_velodyne.sh"
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the necessary command-line arguments are provided
if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
    echo "Error: Incorrect number of arguments. Usage: $0 <target_ip> <rpm_count> <laser_status>"
    exit 1
fi

# Assign command-line arguments to variables
target_ip="$1"
rpm_count="$2"
laser_status="$3"

while true; do
    ping -c 1 $target_ip > /dev/null 2>&1

    # Check the exit status of the ping command
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        break
    else
        sleep 1
    fi
done

curl --data "rpm=$rpm_count" http://$target_ip/cgi/setting
sleep 1
curl --data "laser=$laser_status" http://$target_ip/cgi/setting
```

```python title="/ros_ws/src/velodyne/velodyne_pointcloud/scripts/velodyne_config_manager.py"
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rospy
import subprocess
from std_srvs.srv import Empty, EmptyResponse
import os

class VelodyneConfigManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.target_ip = rospy.get_param("~target_ip", "192.168.1.201")

        script_filename = "config_velodyne.sh"
        script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
        self.script_path = os.path.join(script_dir, script_filename)

    def change_velodyne_config(self, rpm_count, laser_status):
        # Check if the script exists
        if os.path.exists(self.script_path):
            rospy.loginfo("Changing velodyne config at target IP: %s, RPM count: %d, Laser status: %s",
                          self.target_ip, rpm_count, laser_status)

            # Run the Bash script with command-line arguments
            subprocess.run([self.script_path, self.target_ip, str(rpm_count), laser_status])
        else:
            rospy.logerr("Script not found at %s", self.script_path)

    def start_velodyne(self, req):
        self.change_velodyne_config(600, "on")
        return EmptyResponse()

    def stop_velodyne(self, req):
        self.change_velodyne_config(0, "off")
        return EmptyResponse()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rospy.init_node("velodyne_config_manager_node", anonymous=True)
    manager = VelodyneConfigManager()

    # Start velodyne on startup
    manager.change_velodyne_config(600, "on")

    rospy.Service("velodyne_change_rpm_laser_on", Empty, manager.start_velodyne)
    rospy.Service("velodyne_change_rpm_laser_off", Empty, manager.stop_velodyne)

    rospy.spin()

    # Stop after node is shutdown
    manager.change_velodyne_config(0, "off")
```

Create a launch file for the node. Remember to change the value of `target_ip`
parameter to your Velodyne Puck IP.

```xml title="/ros_ws/src/velodyne/velodyne_pointcloud/launch/leo_velodyne.launch"
<launch>
  <param name="target_ip" type="string" value="192.168.1.201" />

  <node name="velodyne_config_manager_node" pkg="leo_velodyne" type="velodyne_config_manager.py" output="screen" />

  <include file="$(find velodyne_pointcloud)/launch/VLP16_points.launch" />
</launch>
```

Now you can add the following lines to `CMakeLists.txt` of the
`velodyne_pointcloud` package:

```title="/ros_ws/src/velodyne/velodyne_pointcloud/CMakeLists.txt"
install(PROGRAMS scripts/velodyne_config_manager.py
        DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION})
```

Build the workspace.

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
catkin build --make-args -j2
```

To run the LiDAR you can now use:

```bash
roslaunch leo_velodyne leo_velodyne.launch
```

If the sensor is launched this way and connection to it can be established, ROS
services to turn the LiDAR on or off are available.

```bash
rosservice call /velodyne_change_rpm_laser_on
```

```bash
rosservice call /velodyne_change_rpm_laser_off
```

## Examples

The robot should publish the `PointCloud2` messages on the `/velodyne_points`
topic. You can check the raw data that it sends by typing:

```bash
rostopic echo /velodyne_points
```

If you have ROS installed on your computer, you can get a more graphical
representation of the data with RViz. If you don't have ROS, you can follow this
guide:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/install-ros-on-your-computer" />

Before starting RViz, make sure you completed the **Connecting another computer
to ROS network** section of **ROS Development** tutorial:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

Now, open RViz by typing `rviz` in the terminal, or, if you have the `leo_viz`
package installed, type:

```bash
roslaunch leo_viz rviz.launch
```

This will start RViz with visualization of the current robot model.

In Global Options change **Fixed Frame** to `velodyne`.

## What next?

Lidars are commonly used in projects involving
[autonomous navigation](/leo-rover/advanced-guides/autonomous-navigation), you
might be interested in a tutorial about it.

They are however, not the only way of teaching a Leo Rover how to move on it's
own. Check out our [line follower](/leo-rover/leo-examples/line-follower)
tutorial if you want to learn more. You can also check our
[Integrations page](/leo-rover/integrations) for more instructions.
