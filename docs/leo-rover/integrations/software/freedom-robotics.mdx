You can use it together with stock Leo Rover UI with only simple steps needed to
integrate.

This way, you'll be able to connect to the rover via the Internet from anywhere
you want. Together with remote driving functionality, Freedom Robotics allows
for data streaming, 3D-mapping visualization, GPS data overlay on the map, and
much more.

## List of components

- Any Computer with internet connectivity.
- Stock Leo Rover

## Software integration

### Create an account on the Freedom Robotics website

<LinkButton to="http://app.freedomrobotics.ai/" title="Freedom Robotics app" />

You can choose either free trial, paid plan or use any dedicated discount code.

Connect to Leo Rover via SSH and connect the robot to the Internet.

:::note

New accounts require some customization. Just press **GET STARTED** button on
the left sidebar. Later in this tutorial we will show you how to fully integrate
your LeoRover with FreedomRobotics.

If you add any robot to your account accidentally (in the customization or in
any other way) don't worry, every device can be deleted from your account in the
device options.

:::

### Adding new robot to your Account

After logging in, you should see the main menu with an overview of your robots.

Start by clicking the **Add Device** button, located in the bottom left corner
of the screen.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-1.webp"
  width="1364"
  height="729"
/>

Then, you can choose whether you want to customize your robot, or get a quick
installation with some base settings. We will choose the **Custom Create**
option.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-2.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="728"
/>

No matter what option you chose, the next step is the same. After a short time,
we get a custom curl command that will install the Freedom Robotics agent when
executed on our rover.

We will run this command in the Leo Rover console, but first, we need to make
sure that some things will get installed. To do so, click the **Advanced
Settings** button.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-3.webp"
  width="1363"
  height="729"
/>

There, look for `REMOTE SSH` and `WEB RTC` settings and make sure both are
checked.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-4.webp"
  width="1363"
  height="727"
/>

You can also see if there is `install_elements=webrtc` fragment in the generated
command.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-5.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Next, you have to run the generated curl command in the LeoRover console. To do
so, you have to connect to Leo Rover via ssh, and the robot needs to have an
internet connection. If Your Leo Rover is running ROS Noetic change "python" at
the end of the copied command to "python3". If You do not remember what ROS
Distro Your rover is using, check it with:

```bash
echo ${ROS_DISTRO}
```

Then, just copy-paste the command and press **Enter**. The installation of the
Freedom Robotics agent will start and you will be asked for the password. Type
in the password (default: `raspberry`) and continue the installation.

:::info

The installation requires your rover to be connected to the internet and may
take a few minutes.

:::

When the installation is complete, the service is installed and will start with
every boot of the system. You can close the ssh connection (press **ctrl+D**)
and go back to Freedom Robotics.

:::info

If you ran into any installation issues, take a look at the
[Installation Help](https://docs.freedomrobotics.ai/docs/installation) guide. If
you're still stuck, please
[reach out](https://docs.freedomrobotics.ai/docs/contact-us)

:::

Now, the **PROCEED** button should be active (if you didn't notice, it was
inactive before the installation). Click it.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-6.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Now, you will be asked for your robot's name. It can be anything you want, we
will continue with `LeoRover`. Enter your robot's name and click the **PROCEED**
button.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-7.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Now, you have to choose the robot's type. If this is your first robot, it's
better to chose from the drop-down list `New Type`, and fully configure your
robot. You can also choose any preset if you have already configured any robot
before - settings will be added automatically.

If you choose `New Type`, you will be asked for the type's name. Same as with
the robot's name, you can choose anything you want. We will continue with
`LeoRobot`. To continue, press **PROCEED**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-8.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

The next step is to choose a group for your robot. The purpose of grouping is to
have devices that will be managed as a unit (e.g. they have the same type, are
in the same area, or are deployed for a specific customer) in one group. You can
choose from already existing groups (if you have added any before), or **Create
New Group**. We will go with the second option and create a `LeoRovers` group.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-9.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

When you provide the group's name, confirm it with Enter and customization will
continue.

#### Customizing Robots Topics

From now on begins the customization of topics for your Freedom Robotics agent.
The steps will be skipped if you have chosen the **Quick Create** option in the
beginning.

The first step is to configure what topics will be allowed to receive commands
from Freedom Robotics. This is useful if you want to add commands for buttons on
the joystick (e.g make a photo when pressing the square button), or if you want
to pilot the robot using the UI joystick in Freedom Robotics. You have 3
options:

- **DEFAULT** - all topics will be commendable from Freedom Robotics
- **CUSTOMIZE** - you choose what topics will be commendable
- **NONE** - no topics will be commendable from Freedom Robotics

:::warning

If you choose NONE option you won't be able to drive the rover with the Freedom
Robotics UI joystick.

:::

We will choose the DEFAULT option and continue by clicking PROCEED.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-10.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Then comes customization of the `Smart Alerts`. At the time of writing this
tutorial, the customization is not possible and you can choose only the
**DEFAULT** option.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-11.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

After this step, adding a new device ends. But we haven't yet configured topics
that will be visible in the Freedom Robotics; therefore, we click **Go To
Device**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-12.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Now we see that the device is connected, although not active even though our
rover is still turned on. That's because Freedom Robotics doesn't get any info
from any topics from the robot. After the configuration, the robot will be
visible as active. So now, from the robot's menu, we go to **Settings**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-13.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

In this section, you can actually change the things that we have configured
earlier (name, type group, etc.) or even delete the device from the account.

We want to customize topics, so we will go to the **Bandwidth** section.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-14.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Here, you can see all the topics (ROS topics) that are monitored by the
interface. If you have chosen the **Quick Create** option, the platform listens
to all the topics running on the rover (`/*` entry in `Included Topics`). It's
better to exclude the ones that are not needed, so if you have it, please delete
the `/*` entry.

Now, we will add the topics that are specific to Leo Rover.

To use the basic functionality of the rover, you should include the topics
below. These are the topics that will be listened to by the platform:

- `/camera/image_raw` - this topic provides the main camera image on Freedom
  Robotics
- `/battery `- this topic will show a battery voltage meter
- `/wheel_odom` - this topic will provide encoders readings
- `/tf `- this topic provides translation vector
- `/diagnostics` - this topic provides diagnostics

`/cmd_vel` is published by default so you don't need to add it.

You add the topic to the Bandwidth by clicking **Add** in the `Included Topics`
section.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-15.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Then, you will have to enter the topic's name and choose the frequency of
sending messages from this topic to the Freedom Robotics platform, from the
drop-down list.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-16.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

:::note

You can choose not to monitor any of the topics, but keep in mind they won't
show in the interface as long they are not in the Included Topics. See more
about bandwidth tuning
[here](https://docs.freedomrobotics.ai/docs/bandwidth-tuning).

:::

This is how our `Included Topics` look in the end.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-17.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

:::info

You can choose different frequencies, but remember that if your configuration
will send to much to the platform it may end in lower performance and quality.

:::

Now, if you go to the main menu, you will see that your device is active.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-18.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

#### Customizing Pilot tab

When you are in the robots settings, go to the **PILOT** section.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-19.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Now, modify `/cmd_vel` `MAX ANGULAR VELOCITY` to 60deg/s and
`MAX LINEAR VELOCITY` to 0.5m/s - choose the right options from the drop-down
lists. Those values are closer to the real speeds the rover can go.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-20.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

These parameters will modify the UI joystick scale to the proper realistic
values.

### Connecting to Leo Rover via Freedom Robotics platform

Start by logging into your
[Freedom Robotics Account](https://app.freedomrobotics.ai/).

Then, in the overview panel, click the **ACTIVE** devices.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-21.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Now, you will see all the active devices. Choose a device that you want to
connect to, and on the panel on the right click the **GO TO DEVICE** button.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-22.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Now you are in the Stream mode of the interface where you can see messages from
the topics added in the **Bandwidth** section. You can play with the modes to
learn how to navigate in the interface.

### Pilot the rover

When connected to the device, go to the **Pilot** mode.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-23.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

You should see a jpeg video stream in the background and UI features. Everyone
who is logged to your account can see the same view as a spectator, but only one
person can take over the control.

Click **Take Over** in the upper section of the video stream.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-24.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Wait a couple of seconds until the streaming method is changed from `JPEG`
stream to `WebRTC` (you'll see that the notice in the image center changes).

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-25.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Now you're able to drive the rover with the red joystick. You can also change
the speed with the slider on the right of the joystick.

## Examples

### Add IMU data streaming

Assemble the IMU module to your Rover and follow the IMU tutorial to enable IMU
data streaming to the ROS environment.

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/integrations/legacy/grove-imu" />

Now, connect to your device via Freedom Robotics and go to the device
**Settings** and then go to the **Bandwidth** section.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-26.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-27.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Now, add a new topic to `Included Topics`.

Include `/imu*` topic - this will include all the topics from the imu sensor.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-28.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

Now, in the `Stream` section you can see data from the IMU topics.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/freedom-robotics/freedom-29.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="727"
/>

#### Congratulations! IMU data is streaming.
