This repository provides a Gazebo simulation of the Navigation and Science Task
for the ERC Remote competition.

The simulation requires `ROS` (Robot Operating System) and was mainly developed
and tested with these distributions:

- [ROS Melodic Morenia](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/) on
  [Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/)
- [ROS Noetic Ninjemys](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/) on
  [Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/)

Other distributions might not work properly so it is recommended to use one of
these two setups.

:::note

The guide will refer to the distribution of your choice (for example melodic or
noetic) as `<distro>`.

:::

The rest of the tools used in this guide can be installed with `apt`:

```bash
# if using ROS Melodic
sudo apt install python-rosdep python-catkin-tools
# if using ROS Noetic
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-catkin-tools
```

## Building

This repository uses `git submodules` to link external repositories that contain
the ROS packages.

When cloning this repository, add the `--recurse-submodules` flag to recursively
pull the submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/EuropeanRoverChallenge/ERC-Remote-Navigation-Sim.git
```

Or if you have already cloned the repository without this option, clone the
submodules using:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Use the `rosdep` tool to install any missing dependencies. If you are running
`rosdep` for the first time, you might have to first run:

```bash
sudo rosdep init
```

Then, to install the dependencies, type:

```bash
rosdep update
sudo apt update
rosdep install --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO} --from-paths src -iy
```

Now, use the `catkin` tool to build the workspace:

```bash
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}
catkin build
```

## Updating

To pull the newest commits and recursively update the submodules, simply type:

```bash
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

If you have already pulled the new commits without the `--recurse-submodules`
flag, you can simply update the submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Run the rosdep install command again. The new versions of the packages may have
pulled some additional dependencies, so you need to install them.

```bash
rosdep install --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO} --from-paths src -iy
```

And rebuild the workspace:

```bash
catkin build
```

## Launching

Make sure you source the `devel` space on each terminal session you want to use
the simulation on:

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```

o start the simulation and `gazebo GUI`, type:

```bash
roslaunch leo_erc_gazebo leo_marsyard.launch
```

To visualize the model in Rviz, type on another terminal session:

```bash
roslaunch leo_erc_viz rviz.launch
```

Turn on the Image panel in `Rviz` to show the simulated camera images.

To test teleoperation with a keyboard, you can run the `key_teleop` node:

```bash
rosrun leo_erc_teleop key_teleop
```

To control the Rover using a joystick, type:

```bash
roslaunch leo_erc_teleop joy_teleop.launch
```

The command mapping was set for the Xbox 360 controller and looks like this:

| Xbox 360Controller     | Command                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| RB                     | button enable - hold it to send commands |
| Left joystick Up/Down  | linear velocity                          |
| Right joystick Up/Down | angular velocity                         |

To modify it, you can edit the **joy_mapping.yaml** file inside the
`leo_erc_teleop` package.
