This tutorial will show you how to program Leo Rover using Scratch 3.0
programming interface.

Scratch is a block-based visual programming language dedicated to education.
It's taught and used in schools and other educational institutions as one of the
best ways to begin your programming adventure. You don't need any knowledge
about software to start using it and it's easy to edit, yet provides all the
basic functionalities of Leo Rover.

## What to expect?

Here is an example of using Scratch with Leo Rover:

<div className="video-container">
  <LiteYouTubeEmbed
    id="UBC4wftwxf0"
    params="autoplay=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0"
    poster="hqdefault"
    title="Leo Rover Unboxing and Getting Started"
    webp
  />
</div>

## Software integration

### Launching Scratch 3.0 Online Editor

First, you need to connect Leo Rover to the internet, and then connect to the
robot's access point (see prerequisites).

When connected to the rover's access point, you can launch Scratch 3.0 GUI.

To launch it, just enter this
[link](http://scratch3-ros.jsk.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp).

When the page loads, you should see something like this:

  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

### Adding ROS Extension

To program Leo Rover using Scratch, we need to add the ROS extension to the GUI.

Click the **Add Extension** button in the bottom left corner. You will see all
the extensions.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-2.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

Find and click **Robot Operating System**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-3.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

Then, in the `Master URI` field, type the rover's `IP` address (default
`10.0.0.1`) and press OK.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-4.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

If everything is ok, you should see something like this. Just click **Go to
Editor** and you are good to go.

## Examples

### Drive Leo Rover with arrows

We created an example Scratch project to help you understand the language.

#### Background

- To make Leo Rover move, we need to publish message on the `/cmd_vel` topic.
- `/cmd_vel` topic takes messages of type
  [geometry_msgs/Twist](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html).
  We will need only the `linear.x` and `angular.z` fields, as those are the only
  axes that Leo Rover moves across.

#### Implementation

:::warning

If you decide to name variables, or functions different than it is in this
tutorial, you will need to pay attention more, as instructions for you will be
slightly different.

:::

As we are going to drive Leo Rover with arrows, we need to do similar things for
all 4 arrows. To work smarter, not harder, first, we will make a function that
tells the rover to drive and rotate with given speed values.

##### Drive Function

Start by defining new block. To do so, select from the left side of the screen
**My Block** panel and press **Make a Block**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-6.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

In the name write `Publish cmd_vel`, or any other name you want to call your
function. Then add two input fields of type `number or text`. Name the first one
`linear`, and the second `angular` and press OK. In the end, the block should
look like this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-7.webp"
  width="695"
  height="543"
  figStyle={{
    width: 400,
  }}
/>

Now we need to make our variable, which will get the values from function, and
will be published to the `/cmd_vel` topic. Similarly to making a new block,
select from the panel on the left **Variables** and then **Make a Variable**.
Name it `cmd_vel` or any other way, and press **OK**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-8.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

We need to reset our variable before publishing, so we need to add `Set` block
from **Variables** panel, to our `Publish cmd_vel` block. From the list choose
your variable (in our case `cmd_vel`) and for the value type `0`.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-9.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

After those steps our function should look like this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-10.webp"
  width="275"
  height="121"
  figStyle={{
    width: 300,
  }}
/>

Now, we need to store the value from `linear` and `angular` fields (function
input) in our variable. As we have said in the background, `/cmd_vel` topic
takes message of given type. To make it work with our variable, we can't use
again `Set` block from **Variables** panel. We need to do it with the `Set`
block, but from **ROS** panel. This block, will guarantee us, that the value
from linear and angular fields will go to the corresponding fields from the ROS
message (`linear.x` and `angular.z`).

So from the **ROS** panel pick `Set` block, and add it to function twice (we
have two inputs in our function).

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-11.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

Now, we need to fill those blocks. For the variable we obviously pick `cmd_vel`.
Now we need to specify the data which will be set in each of these `Set` blocks.
One should be `linear.x` and the other `angular.z`.

Now we need to fill the value fields with corresponding input fields. So **drag
and drop** input fields from the function in the correct places. This is how
your function should look like at this moment:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-12.webp"
  width="260"
  height="188"
  figStyle={{
    width: 300,
  }}
/>

So we have our message. Now we need to publish it on the `/cmd_vel` topic. To do
this, we need to add to our function `Publish` block from **ROS** panel.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-13.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

Now we need to fill this block. We pick our `cmd_vel` variable, and `/cmd_vel`
topic from all available topics. In the end our function looks like this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-14.webp"
  width="273"
  height="230"
  figStyle={{
    width: 300,
  }}
/>

##### Connecting the function with arrows

As we have the drive function ready, we need to implement the driving with
arrows. To do so, we need to catch when the arrow is pressed, and for each press
we need to call our `Publish cmd_vel` function.

To do so, we are going to use `When <key> is pressed` block from **Events**
panel. We need to pick four of those blocks, as there are four arrow keys.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/scratch/scratch-15.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

Replace `Space` with left, right, up and down arrow. Now, for each of those
blocks, we need to add our function. You can find it in the **My Block** panel.

The only thing that is left is filling the input fields in the functions. We
need to pick the values carefully so that Leo Rover performs correct actions on
arrows (up/down - driving forward/backward, left/down - rotating left/right).
Here are the values that we have filled:

| Arrow key   | Linear value | Angular Value |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| up arrow    | 0.5          | 0             |
| down arrow  | -0.5         | 0             |
| right arrow | 0            | -1.2          |
| left arrow  | 0            | 1.2           |

:::info

Values in the `Linear Value` column are given in meters per second. Positive
value means that Rover will drive forward, negative means that it will drive
backwards. Values in the `Angular Value` column are given in radians per second.
Positive value means that Rover will rotate left, negative value means that it
will rotate right.

Changing the values will result in the Rover driving / rotating faster or
slower.

:::

Now, you can press the arrow keys having the Scratch GUI open, and the rover
should move.

:::info

Make sure that the ROS extension is connected with the rover. You can check if
it is connected by clicking the icon next to ROS panel header.

If it's disconnected, you can establish connection once again by pressing the
icon, and providing the Master URI (Rover's IP address).
