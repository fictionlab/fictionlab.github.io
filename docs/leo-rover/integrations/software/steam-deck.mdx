In this tutorial, we will show you how to use the Steam Deck with your Leo
Rover.

If you want to use your Leo Rover in the field or somewhere outside the comfy
lab environment, you may find operating from your host machine to be quite
problematic. That's where a much smaller and handy device comes in - giving you
full control over your rover at all times.

## What to expect?

With Steam Deck's capabilities of a full-fledged computer, the range of its
possibilities is virtually endless. So, we can't demonstrate every potential
use, but we can give you a glimpse of its possibilities by showing you how we've
applied it to our use case as an example.

## List of components

- Steam Deck,
- Keyboard and (eventually) mouse,
- USB C - USB adapter.

## Software integration

:::info

In this part we are assuming you have your Steam Deck connected to the internet,
and you are operating in the desktop mode (instructions how to enter the desktop
[here](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/how-to-get-to-desktop-mode-on-steam-deck-4296327))

As you will need to write some commands in the console on the Steam Deck, we
recommend, for your comfort, to connect a keyboard and mouse to the device. You
can also open this tutorial on the browser in the Steam Deck, to be able to copy
paste the instructions.

:::

To run ROS applications on the Steam Deck, we need to install ROS itself. But as
it's not so simple to do on the SteamOS, first, you need to get another Linux
distribution on your device.

In order to get Ubuntu 20.04 on your Steam Deck, you can follow the
[install Ubuntu on distrobox tutorial](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/distrobox-can-open-up-the-steam-deck-to-a-whole-new-world/)
by Liam Dawe.

:::note

As the system installed in distrobox has only the basic packages, before next
step you need to install some additional tools. Being in ubuntu 20.04 on your
Steam Deck please perform this installation

```bash
sudo apt install lsb-release
```

:::

Once you have completed the steps and can access Ubuntu 20.04 on your Steam
Deck, you need to perform the ROS installation. You can follow
[this](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) guide.

:::warning

Remember that you need to install ROS inside the distrobox environment (Ubuntu
20.04), otherwise the installation will fail.

:::

Having completed the installation, you are ready to try our examples!

## Examples

:::info

The examples described in this section were done for a rover configuration which
has integrated lidar and realsense camera. You can follow those guides to get
the same rover setup:

<LinkButton to="intel-realsense-camera" title="Intel RealSense camera" />
<LinkButton to="rplidar-a2" title="RPLiDAR A2M8 / A2M12" />

Also for the examples to work, you have to connect your SteamDeck to the rover's
access point.

:::

We have provided a GitHub repository with additional files and setup script
needed to perform our use-cases of the Steam Deck with Leo Rover.

But first, you need two `ROS` packages. Execute this command in distrobox image:

```bash
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-leo
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-realsense2-description
```

Having installed those packages, clone
[this](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_SteamDeck) repository into your Steam
Deck:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_SteamDeck.git
```

:::note

You don't have to do the cloning from the ubuntu 20.04 image. If you clone the
repository from the SteamOS, you will be able to access the files from ubuntu
image. If you still want to clone the repo while being in the ubuntu, then you
have to install git:

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

:::

Once you clone the repository, all you have to do is to enter the directory with
the files and run the `setup.sh` script:

```bash
cd leo_SteamDeck
./setup.sh
```

When the script finishes the setup, you will see four applications on the
desktop:

- `Leo Movement` - example which allows you to operate the rover from your Steam
  Deck and display camera image,
- `Leo Lidar` - example which allows you to operate the rover from the Steam
  Deck and display LiDAR scan data in RViz,
- `Leo Depth Camera` - example which allows you to operate the rover from the
  SteamDeck and display depth data in RViz,
- `Virtual Keyboard`- applications that run virtual keyboard - useful when you
  don't have connected physical keyboard.

:::tip

To use the virtual keyboard, you need to install **inside the ubuntu 20.04
image** florence app:

```bash
sudo apt install florence
```

:::

To move the rover while the chosen app is running, use the `left joystick` while
holding the `L1` button. Moving the joystick forward/backwards controls the
rover's linear speed, and left/right controls the angular speed.

:::info

If your rover doesn't move with this setup, try unplugging all docking stations
and external devices of your SteamDeck, and restart the device.

If this doesn't help, there is a file `steam_deck_config.yaml` inside the
`leo_SteamDeck/configs` directory. There are defined mappings for the axes and
enable button. You can change the predefined values of those parameters to
whatever axes and button id's you want. To find the id's of buttons and axes go
on your SteamDeck into **System Settings** -> **Input Devices** -> **Game
Controller** (remember that the id's you will put in the file are indexed from 0
not 1, so if you want e.g button nr 4 you need to put 3 in the file).

One last solution is to check the **Controller Action**. If it's set to
**Desktop** then you won't get any readings from joysticks and buttons. You can
switch the mode with the **Start** button (the one with three stripes next to A
B X Y buttons) by holding it for some time. Current mode will be displayed in
the bottom right corner of your screen (It needs to be in **Gamepad** mode for
our applications to work).

Here you can see demonstration of usage of the described applications in our
example:
