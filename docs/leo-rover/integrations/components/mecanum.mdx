Mecanum wheels are a common way of giving mobile robots holonomic motion
abilities. While not flawless e.g., difficult terrain traversal with mecanum
wheels is much more difficult, mounting mecanum wheels to Leo Rover comes with
many benefits, with the most important being:

- Ability to strafe.
- Great reduction in resistances seen while driving (especially when turning).
- Chance to mount heavier payload.

## What to expect?

Having finished the tutorial you'll know how to convert Leo Rover to holonomic
motion mode.

## List of components

- 4 x Mecanum wheel (2 for each roller orientation)
- 4 x Mecanum torque plate

## Mechanical integration

There are two ways mecanum wheels can be arranged:

While both configurations can work, “X” from the top seems to be more prevalent
in robotics as it makes turning around the center more consistent. That's why
software we provide assumes the „X” configuration is being used.

## Software integration

Adding the wheels to the software is really simple. You only need to change a
single thing in one file and restart the rover. In `/etc/ros/setup.bash` file
there is one environment variable `MECANUM_WHEELS` that is exported to the
system. You need to change its value to true:

```bash title="/etc/ros/setup.bash"
export MECANUM_WHEELS=true
```

You can edit the file using this command:

```bash
nano /etc/ros/setup.bash
```

And then save its content with **Ctrl+O** and confirming with enter. You exit
the program with **Ctrl+X**.

Once it's done, you can just reboot the rover, and the wheels will be included
in the software running on the robot.

## Examples

### Visualize Robot Model

If you have ROS installed on your computer, you can see the robot model with the
mecanum wheels attached in RViz.

Before making any further steps, make sure you completed the Connecting another
computer to ROS network section of ROS Development tutorial:

<LinkButton
  to="/docs/leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development#connecting-another-computer-to-ros-network"
  description="ROS development / Connection another computer to ROS network"
/>

To see the model, start `rviz`, and add **robot model** in the **display** view.
Chose also `base_footprint` as **fixed frame**, and you should see the rover
model with mecanum wheels attached.
