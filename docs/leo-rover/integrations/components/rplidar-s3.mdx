This tutorial will guide you through the process of connecting a LiDAR sensor to
your Leo Rover.

Light Detection and Ranging devices, or lidars for short, are mechanisms used
for mapping the environment, object detection, tracking the speed of vehicles
and in a vide range of other applications. In robotics 2D lidars, like A2M8 /
A2M12, are used for things such as indoor SLAM
([Simultaneous localization and mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping))
or safety systems.

## What to expect?

After finishing the tutorial you should be able to both gather the lidar data
and visualize it using RViz. Just like in the image below:

## List of components

- RPLidar S3
- RPLidar S3 adapter plate (can be found here:
  [Addon adapters](/docs/leo-rover/documentation/addon-adapters#rplidar-s3-adapter))
- M5x10 Allen head screw x4
- M2.5x6 Allen head screw x4

## Mechanical integration

We developed 3D printable models of mechanical interfaces that allow you to
mount the aforementioned sensor to the mounting plate of the rover. Locating the
sensor the top of the robot provides a vide field of view with not many
obstacles for the laser beam to get caught on. Get the files from here:
[Addon Adapters](/docs/leo-rover/documentation/addon-adapters/).

- With 4 x M2.5x6 Allen screws connect the sensor to the printed interface
  plate.
- Use 4 x M5x10 Allen screws to fasten the sensor to the Leo Rover.

## Wiring and electronics connection

The sensor can be connected to the robot's main computer via the USB socket
positioned at the top of the rover. If your USB cable is long it might get into
lidars field of view if it sticks up too much. try to hide it in the empty space
inside Leo Rovers back frame. Just like on the photo below:

:::info

When mounting the sensor, you should be particularly careful not to obstruct the
field of view by other parts of the Rover.

:::

The sensor can be connected to the robot's main computer via the USB socket
positioned at the top of the rover.

USB connection provides power to the sensor and allows the data transfer. This
means that no external power sources are necessary. Some lidars might need
external power connections, that's when
[Powerbox](https://www.leorover.tech/shop/powerbox) might come in handy.

With everything connected you are ready to try out your new sensor.

## Software integration

The first thing you can do is to make sure your device has the correct
permissions and is available at the fixed path on your system. To do this, you
can add the following rule to the udev service:

```xml title="/etc/udev/rules.d/lidar.rules"
KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea60", MODE="0666", GROUP="dialout", SYMLINK+="lidar"
```

Paste these lines to `/etc/udev/rules.d/lidar.rules` file and reload udev rules
by typing:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

Your device should now be available at the `/dev/lidar` path.

We want the sensor functionality to be available in the ROS ecosystem, so you
should install a ROS package that provides a node for the sensor you are trying
to integrate.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rplidar-ros
```

Now, create a launch file that would start the node with a fitting
configuration.

```xml title="/etc/ros/laser.launch"
<launch>
  <node name="rplidar_node" pkg="rplidar_ros" type="rplidarNode" output="screen">
    <param name="serial_port" value="/dev/lidar"/>
    <param name="frame_id" value="laser_frame"/>
    <param name="serial_baudrate" value="1000000"/>
  </node>
</launch>
```

Include your launch file in the `robot.launch` file, so that your node will
start at boot.

In `/etc/ros/robot.launch`:

```xml
<include file="/etc/ros/laser.launch"/>
```

Your robot should be aware of where the sensor is located and what space it
occupies. You can ensure it does that by creating a URDF model of the sensor.

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/laser.urdf.xacro"
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot>

  <link name="sp3lidar_link">
    <visual>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.009"/>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.08 0.08 0.018"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="support">
        <color rgba="0 0 0 0.6"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <visual>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.02975"/>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.055 0.055 0.0235"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="base">
        <color rgba="0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <visual>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.0504"/>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder radius="0.0253" length="0.0178"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="lidar">
        <color rgba="1.0 0.0 0.0 0.7"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.009"/>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.08 0.08 0.018"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <collision>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.02975"/>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.055 0.055 0.0235"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <collision>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.0504"/>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder radius="0.0253" length="0.0178"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
  </link>

  <joint name="sp3lidar_joint" type="fixed">
    <origin xyz="0.0775 0 0.0"/>
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="sp3lidar_link"/>
  </joint>

  <link name="laser_frame"/>

  <joint name="laser_joint" type="fixed">
    <origin xyz="0 0 0.048" rpy="0 0 3.14159"/>
    <parent link="sp3lidar_link"/>
    <child link="laser_frame"/>
  </joint>

</robot>
```

And including it in the description that is uploaded at boot.

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro"
<xacro:include filename="/etc/ros/urdf/laser.urdf.xacro"/>
```

:::tip

You can experiment with the URDF file and create a more representative model of
the sensor by adding more visual and collision tags or by including meshes in
STL or COLLADA format.

:::

The last step is to either reboot the robot or restart the leo service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

## Examples

### Reading and visualizing the data

The robot should now publish the
[LaserScan messages](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html)
on the `/scan` topic. You can check the raw data that it sends by typing:

```bash
rostopic echo /scan
```

If you have ROS installed on your computer, you can get a more graphical
representation of the data with RViz. If you don't have ROS, you can follow this
guide:

<LinkButton
  to="/docs/leo-rover/advanced-guides/install-ros-on-your-computer"
  description="Install ROS on your computer"
/>

Before starting RViz, make sure you completed the **Connecting another computer
to ROS network** section of **ROS Development** tutorial:

<LinkButton
  to="/docs/leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development#connecting-another-computer-to-ros-network"
  description="ROS development / Connecting another computer to ROS network"
/>

Now, open RViz by typing `rviz` in the terminal, or, if you have the `leo_viz`
package installed, type:

```bash
roslaunch leo_viz rviz.launch
```

This will start RViz with visualization of the current robot model.

On the Displays panel click **Add** -> **By topic** and search for the `/scan`
topic. Choose the **LaserScan** display and click **Ok**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/hokuyo-lidar/rviz-laser-scan.webp"
  width="1362"
  height="727"
/>

You should now be able to see the data from the sensor visualized as points in
3D space.

To put the points into the camera image, you can also add the **Camera**
display.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/hokuyo-lidar/rviz-add-camera.webp"
  width="1364"
  height="730"
/>

Be sure to check `compressed` as the Transport Hint and `/camera/image_raw` as
the Image Topic.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/hokuyo-lidar/rviz-camera-topic.webp"
  width="1365"
  height="729"
/>

Here's an example end result:

<div className="video-container">
  <LiteYouTubeEmbed
    id="oD5Sp7T0Ki0"
    params="autoplay=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0"
    poster="hqdefault"
    title="Leo Rover Unboxing and Getting Started"

  />
</div>

## What next?

Lidars are commonly used in projects involving
[autonomous navigation](/docs/leo-rover/advanced-guides/autonomous-navigation),
you might be interested in a tutorial about it.

They are however, not the only way of teaching a Leo Rover how to move on it's
own. Check out our
[line follower](/docs/leo-rover/integrations/leo-examples/line-follower)
tutorial if you want to learn more. You can also check our
[Knowledge Base](/docs/category/integrations) for more instructions.
