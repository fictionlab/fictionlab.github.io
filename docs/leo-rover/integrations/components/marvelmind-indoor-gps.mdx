  Marvelmind Indoor GPS integration guide for Leo Rover, an off-the-shelf indoor
  navigation system for autonomous robots.
---

In this tutorial, we will show you how to connect Marvelmind Indoor GPS system
with Leo Rover.

**Marvelmind Indoor Navigation System** is an off-the-shelf indoor navigation
system, designed to provide precise (±2cm) location data to autonomous robots,
vehicles (AGV), and copters. It can also be used to track moving objects via
mobile beacons attached to them. Other applications include, for example,
forklifts, virtual reality (VR) systems, helmets for construction workers or
miners, etc.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we have prepared `leo_marvelmind` package
which makes use of Marvelmind ROS packages to provide the rover's estimated
position, from the Marvelmind system. You won't have to write a single line of
code, but some configuration may need to be tweaked to work best in your
environment.

Make sure you are operating on the newest image for the Raspberry Pi and you are
up-to-date with the packages and have the newest firmware flashed.

You will also need to have ROS installed on your computer and some previous
experience with ROS is also recommended.

This tutorial was done on linux. If you are using windows, you might need to
download and install STM32 Drivers and (optionally) DfuSe (DFU programmer). Both
can be found on [Marvelmind page](https://marvelmind.com/download/).

## List of components

In this tutorial, we integrate Marvelmind Starter Set Super-MP-3D consisting of:

- 4 stationary [Super-Beacons](https://marvelmind.com/product/super-beacon/)
- 1 mobile [Super-Beacon](https://marvelmind.com/product/super-beacon/)
- 1 [Modem v5.1](https://marvelmind.com/product/modem-hw-v5-1/) supporting up to
  250 beacons

Marvelmind provides a few architectures for their system. This tutorial is
configured for `Inverse Architecture (IA)`:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/inverse-architecture.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="693"
/>

Here is a quick comparison of the architectures:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/architecture-comparison.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="530"
/>

You can find some more information in this and
[FAQ section](https://marvelmind.com/faq/) on the Marvelmind page.

:::note

Inverse architecture requires stationary beacons to have different frequencies.

:::

## Software integration

### Downloading Marvelmind software and API

In order to use Marvelmind system for navigation, you need Marvelmind API and
their software. In the software, you can find the newest firmware for the
beacons and modem, and API is needed to upload it to the device.

To download the required files, you can go to Marvelmind
[page with downloads](https://marvelmind.com/download/), and find the newest
package, or download it from
[here](https://marvelmind.com/pics/marvelmind_SW.zip).

Once you have downloaded the package, you need to unzip it. On Linux, it can be
done with the `unzip` command line tool. In terminal, just go to the directory
where the zip file has been downloaded (default is `~/Downloads`) and type:

```bash
unzip marvelmind_SW.zip
```

Then, in the extracted directory, go to `Dashboard/linux`. The next directory
you need to choose based on your computer's architecture (for us it was `x86`).

:::tip

In the `Dashboard/linux` directory, there is a PDF file with instructions for
the linux versions of dashboard. It's worth to do the things described there.

:::

You can check what your architecture is with:

```bash
uname -m
```

or:

```bash
dpkg --print-architecture
```

Then, go to the specified directory, and give execution rights to
`dashboard_<computer architecture>` file:

```bash
chmod +x dashboard_x86
```

### Updating firmware on beacons and modem

:::note

For each beacon you will need to do the same things. There is only one
additional step for the mobile beacon, but it will be mentioned later.

Beacon configuration requires it to be connected to the computer, so it might be
faster for you to complete upgrading and configuring beacon and then switching
to the next beacon, than switching beacons after firmware update, and then
connecting them once again, for configuration.

:::

First, charge all the beacons with a USB cable (full charging takes 2-4 hours).

Run the dashboard by typing in the correct directory:

```bash
./dashboard_<computers architecture>
```

You should see something like this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/dashboard.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

Now, you need to turn on your beacons (or just the currently upgraded ones not
to waste the battery in other beacons) by placing the DIP switches like it is
shown below:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/dip-switches.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="331"
/>

Now, connect the beacon to the computer with the USB cable. Once it is found,
your screen should change to something like this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/connected-beacon.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

:::info

If you have problems with connecting beacons to the computer, there are some
solutions:

- Check with `dmesg -w` if your computer detects connection of usb device (run
  it before connecting beacon to computer),
- If you see the message “**Not found modem connection to computer through
  USB**” it usually means that you don't have STM32 drivers installed. To
  install the driver, down load it with link at top window in the Dashboard and
  run the installation file, then click on the link under and install the
  driver.

:::

If your beacon is connected, go to **Firmware** -> **Upload firmware**. You
should see a new window.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/upload-firmware.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

Click **Open file** and choose the correct firmware file. As we are integrating
for Inverse Architecture, choose from the base directory of unzipped package
**Software_ia**. Then, choose **super_beacon_ia** (if you have some other type
of beacon, choose the directory for your device). From there, choose the `.hex`
file (there should be only one in the directory) and click **Open**. Then, click
the **Next** button in the bottom part of the window, and the firmware upload
will start.

:::info

For modem, the only difference is that from `Software_ia` directory you need to
choose `modem_hw51_ia` or `modem_hw49_ia` directory, depending on the type of
the modem you have.

:::

When the update is complete, you will see something like this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/firmware-update-completed.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

:::warning

Make sure that you upload right firmware (beacon's SW to beacons and modem's SW
to modem) and that you chose right version of the device (if you have doubts,
you can check it on the sticker that's on the bottom part of the device).

:::

If you have any problems with HEX programming, use DFU. Full instruction can be
found
[here](https://marvelmind.com/pics/marvelmind_navigation_system_manual.pdf) on
page 109.

### Configuring Beacons

While the beacon is connected, click **Default** in the dashboard to upload the
default settings (the beacon will reconnect to the dashboard).

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/configure-beacons-1.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

Change the **Device address** at your convenience (it's important, as we will
wake the beacons based on their IDs).

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/configure-beacons-2.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

Change the **Ultrasonic frequency** to the frequency given on the sticker on the
bottom side of the device.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/configure-beacons-3.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

You can also change the **Radio frequency** band to some value that is legal in
your country.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/configure-beacons-4.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

**Only for the mobile beacon**: change the **Hedgehog mode** to `enabled`.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/configure-beacons-5.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

Choose IMU mode `Normal` from **IMU** section.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/configure-beacons-6.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

**Only for the mobile beacon**: in **Interfaces** section enable **Processed IMU
data** and **Raw internal sensors data**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/configure-beacons-7.webp"
  width="500"
  height="788"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

:::info

Don't worry if during configuration device reconnects to the computer, it
sometimes happens.

:::

To save changes, press **Write changes** in the upper right part of the
dashboard, and reset the device (the button above the DIP switches for beacon;
the button on the side - for modem).

### Mounting Beacons to the walls

With each beacon, there is a velcro in the box. You need to attach one part to
the beacon, and the other to the wall.

Place the stationary beacons high on the walls vertically in a way that will
provide optimal ultrasonic coverage (make sure that the antenna is in the upper
right corner of the beacons).

Measure the height at which the beacons are placed, as we will need it for
future change in settings.

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY0HkLzmjys) with additional
instructions on installing the beacons on the walls.

Possible setup:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/mounting-setup-1.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="558"
/>

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/mounting-setup-2.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="772"
/>

:::warning

Make sure that beacons can "see" each other. If there is something in the way,
the system might have problems with measuring distance between beacons.

:::

### Setting Map

If you have turned off the dashboard, turn it on and connect the modem to your
computer. Turn on all the stationary beacons. Now, you need to wake them up. In
the dashboard, with the connected modem (in the lower left corner, the modem
should be shown as connected), in the lower part of the dashboard, there are
numbers of devices. Double click on a number to wake up a device with a given
number.

:::info

It might take 7-10 seconds for the beacons to wake up.

:::

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/setting-map-1.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

Now, when the beacons are turned on, the system may run the frequency search if
it is the very first time you are waking up the beacons.

:::note

If this step does not work, disconnect the modem and connect that beacon again
via USB. Press the DEFAULT button in the Dashboard and the Read All button to
make sure that the radio settings are the default ones.

Also check that the radio settings on the modem and the radio settings on the
beacon are the same.

:::

Now, by clicking on the woken device, you can see and change its options (you
can check RSSI, voltage, ultrasonic filter settings, etc.) on the panel in the
right part of the Dashboard.

:::info

Double click on the device to both put it into sleep mode and to wake it up.

If the modem is not active and is not powered, the beacons will go into sleep
mode automatically after 1 minute

:::

For each beacon you have turned on, enter the height it's placed at.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/setting-map-2.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

At this moment, the map should zoom in and form automatically. If the map didn't
form well, check the table of distances in the upper left corner.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/setting-map-3.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

:::note

Only 4 stationary beacons may be in 1 submap. If you wake up more beacons,
create new submap for them. Or it won't be displayed on the map and in the table
of distances.

:::

Next, you need to make the service zone. To do so, just press **Shift+Left mouse
button** on the map to add a point (press the same combination on a point to
remove it). Two points will form a line; three and more - a polygon. In the end,
you should have something like this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/setting-map-4.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

The last step is to freeze the submap and the map (provided that everything in
the previous steps was good). When you freeze the map, stationary beacons will
stop measuring relative distances and will be ready to measure distance from the
mobile beacon.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/setting-map-5.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

#### Solving problems with table of distances

If in the table you see some empty cells (except for the cells on diagonal) or
marked yellow/red, it is an indication that distances between some beacons are
measured inconsistently or are not measured at all. Try re-positioning them
because usually there is an obstruction of some sort between the beacons.

You can also input the distance between beacons manually. To do so, just
**right-click** on a cell that corresponds to a given pair of beacons, then,
choose **Enter distance for pair**. After that, you can also freeze the distance
for that pair (or you can later freeze the whole submap at once).

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/distance-table.webp"
  width="500"
  height="323"
  figStyle={{
    width: 400,
  }}
/>

Here are the meanings of possible cell colors:

- white - everything is good, you can freeze the map
- yellow - something seems to be wrong, check distances and sensors before
  freezing
- red - some critical misses, do not freeze the map; manually measure and input
  distance, or reposition the beacon
- green - frozen distance, you can freeze the map, but be careful with values

It's also worth considering the diagnostic messages in the upper part of the
Dashboard. There, you can find important system's messages which may contain a
lot of useful information (for example, a message about repeating beacon
frequency when you have IA).

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/diagnostic-messages.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="696"
/>

### Starting measurement

As you could mount beacons to the walls, you can also mount the mobile beacon on
the rover using velcro.

:::warning

For the beacon to have the same rotation axes as the rover, you need to mount it
in such way, that the beacon antenna is in the upper right corner, when looking
from above the rover (in z axis).

You also need to connect the mobile beacon to the rover, with a micro-usb cable
(connect the cable to the slot, of the beacon, which you used to charge the
beacons), to the usb socket on the rover's mounting plate (you may need some
adapters to do so).

:::

When you have the map, and mobile beacon is mounted on the rover, you can turn
it on following the steps for stationary beacons (turn on the power of the
beacon, wake it up in the dashboard, input height). After you have done those
steps, mobile beacon should be traceable in 5-7 seconds. The system is now fully
operational.

:::info

It's possible, that after waking the mobile beacon, you will have to unfreeze
the map, and freeze it again. Doing this, will allow the system to add the
mobile beacon to the map. Follow the diagnostic messages in case of a problem.

:::

## Examples

### Marvelmind navigation with ROS

Right now, the only way we see the estimated position of the rover is in the
dashboard. But it would be more useful to integrate the Marvelmind navigation
system with ROS, as it will allow us to do anything with the position (for
example, navigating the rover).

To do so, we utilize
[leo_marvelmind](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_marvelmind) package which
provides:

- marvelmind `hedge_rcv_bin` node which is able to communicate with mobile
  beacon or modem and provide received location and other data
- nodes for parsing messages from Marvelmind topics to ROS msgs
- robot localization nodes to have estimation of the rover position using rover
  data and Marvelmind data

#### Installing packages:

First you need to download our `leo_marvelmind` package, from github repository.
To do so, connect to the rover via ssh. Once you are connected, you need to
download the package in your `ros workspace`, in the src directory. If it's in
your home directory, type:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_marvelmind_tutorial.git
```

Now we need to install all required rosdep dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
source devel/setup.bash
rosdep install --from-paths src -i
```

And in the end, if everything installed successfully, you have to build the
package:

```bash
catkin build
```

#### Adding mobile beacon to URDF model

The rover should be aware of where the beacon is located, and what space it
occupies. You can ensure it does that by making URDF model of the beacon.

We will have separate URDF file for the beacon model, and we will link it to the
rover's URDF.

Our beacon model is `5.5 x 5.5 x 6.5 cm` large, and we mounted it `7 cm` in
front of the mounting hole that serves as a `base_link` in robot's URDF model.
Therefore, our beacon URDF model looks like this:

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/beacon.urdf.xacro"
<?xml version="1.0"?>

 <robot xmlns:xacro="http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro">
  <!-- a link representing visual and collision
       properties of the sensor -->
  <link name="beacon_base_link">
    <visual>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.02"/>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.055 0.055 0.065"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="red">
        <color rgba="1 0 0 0.7"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.02"/>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.055 0.055 0.065"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
  </link>

  <!-- fixed joint that attaches
       the sensor to the rover's body -->
  <joint name="beacon_base_joint" type="fixed">
    <origin xyz="0.07 0 0"/>
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="beacon_base_link"/>
  </joint>

  <!-- reference frame for sensor readings -->
  <link name="beacon_frame"/>

  <!-- fixed joint that sets the origin
       of the reference frame -->
  <joint name="beacon_joint" type="fixed">
    <origin xyz="0 0 0.02"/>
    <parent link="beacon_base_link"/>
    <child link="beacon_frame"/>
  </joint>

 </robot>
```

Now, we need to link it to the main urdf file. To do so, you need to include
this line in `/etc/ros/robot.urdf.xacro` file (somewhere between `<robot>` and
`</robot>` tags):

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro"
<xacro:include filename="/etc/ros/urdf/beacon.urdf.xacro"/>
```

Now, to make beacon visible for the rover, you need to reboot the robot, or
restart `leo` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart leo
```

#### Description of all the nodes and topics

- `hedge_rcv_bin` - node from `marvelmind_nav` package. Gives us topics:
  - `hedge_pos_ang` which contains the position of mobile beacon returned from
    marvelmind system
  - `hedge_imu_fusion` which contains fused data from mobile beacon imu
  - `hedge_imu_raw` with raw data from imu
- `wheel_odom_parser` which subscribes to `wheel_odom` topic, and adds to it
  covariance matrix. It's also publishing such message as
  `TwistWithCovarianceStamped` msg on `wheel_odom_with_covariance` topic
- `pose_parser` which takes the pose from marvelmind system, adds to the
  position wheel odometry with covariance, and publishes it as `Odometry` msg.
- `imu_parser` which subscribes to marvelmind imu topics, and organizes two
  messages into `sensor_msgs/Imu`
- `robot_loc_odom` and `robot_loc_map` which are robot localization nodes. One
  publishing odom to base link transform, and the other map to odom.

Lists of parameters for parsers are in the `leo_marvelmind/config` directory.
Except for subscribed/published topic names, there are also covariances, so you
can change those at your convenience.

You can run all nodes using `marvelmind_localization.launch` file by sourcing
the devel directory and typing command:

```bash
roslaunch leo_marvelmind marvelmind_localization.launch
```

Here's a diagram that illustrates the nodes launched by the
`marvelmind_localization.launch` file and the connections between them:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/marvelmind-gps/marvelmind-gps-node-graph.webp"
  width="1300"
  height="369"
/>

Then, you can also run `rviz` (on your computer if it is not installed on the
rover - you need to export ros variables) and add robot model, and visualize the
estimated position (remember to chose map as fixed frame). You can find more
instructions here:
