In this tutorial, we'll show you how to connect Arduino to Leo Rover.

## What is Arduino?

Before we get started, let's say a few words about what Arduino actually is.

**Arduino** is an open-source electronic platform that allows users to easily
access advanced technologies interacting with the physical world.

### What do I need Arduino for?

You might wonder what the point of having Arduino inside Leo Rover is. After
all, isn't the robot already equipped with a Raspberry Pi micro-computer?

Well, the simplicity of Arduino makes it more convenient for typical hardware
projects. Arduino has analog capabilities that the Raspberry Pi lacks by
default. Its flexibility allows you to work with almost any type of sensor.

Arduino speeds up the creation of simple projects that don't require advanced
software and a good Internet connection.

Let's not forget that behind the name "Arduino" hide many boards, so if you want
to learn how to choose the best one for your project, look
[here](https://www.leorover.tech/post/how-to-choose-the-right-arduino-board).
For our projects, we mostly use **Arduino DUE**.

## What to expect?

Having finished the tutorial you'll know how to connect Arduino to the Leo Rover
and use its potential to further improve your projects and make the development
process of future projects a little bit faster.

## List of components

- Any Arduino ( or any other compatible board)
- Any way of connecting the board to the rover
- USB cable

## Mechanical integration

We have created mechanical interfaces for Arduino DUE, which you can get here:

<LinkButton
  to="/docs/leo-rover/documentation/addon-adapters#arduino-due"
  description="Addon adapters / Arduino Due"
/>

You'll need to press in ten M3, threaded heat-set inserts into the base part.
This allows you to use M3x6 Allen screws to hold the Arduino securely. The cover
is held by 4 screws of the same size.

Since Arduino Due has the largest footprint out of all the Arduino boards it
should be pretty easy to adapt the provided Arduino DUE adapter models to fit
other boards inside. All you need to do is use 3D CAD program like **Autodesk
Fusion** to change the way mounting holes for the board are positioned.

## Wiring and electronics connection

For most intents and purposes the only connection you need to provide is an USB
connection between the board and the USB port at the top of the rover. However,
you may want to provide the microcontroller, and the sensors that you are using,
with external power source. For such cases powerbox addon might be a good
choice.

## Software integration

There are several ways to integrate Arduino into the rover. From this tutorial,
you'll learn about two of them so that you can decide which one works best for
you.

<Tabs groupId="software-integration">
  <TabItem value="mechanical-eng" label="Mechanical engineer way">
    <Admonition type="info">
      This way saves you from having to dive into the rover's insides. It works;
      however, it does not allow you to communicate between the rover's onboard
      computer and Arduino - this, in turn, makes it harder to use the data
      harvested by any sensors connected to the Arduino.
    </Admonition>

    First, install Arduino IDE using any of those provided tutorials:

    - [Arduino IDE installation and setup (Windows)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
    - [Arduino IDE installation and setup (Linux)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux)

    Then, you need to set up Arduino IDE (we're using Arduino DUE which needs a
    special configuration in Arduino IDE).

    To do so, do as follows: while in IDE, go to: **Tools** -> **Board** -> **Boards
    Manager**

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-board-manager.webp"
      width="954"
      height="515"
    />

    Type `DUE` in the search bar and install the latest version of
    `Arduino SAM Boards` (32-bits ARM Cortex-M3).

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-board-manager-due.webp"
      width="976"
      height="224"
    />

    The next step is to take care of the board specific setup:

    - Connect the board to a USB port in your computer (use the port closer to the
      barrel jack socket)
    - Go to: **Tools** -> **Board** -> **Arduino ARM (32-bits) Boards** and choose
      **Arduino Due (Programming Port)**

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-programming-port.webp"
      width="955"
      height="515"
    />

    - Go to: **Tools** -> **Port** and choose the port Arduino is connected to

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-programming-port-2.webp"
      width="955"
      height="515"
    />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="software-eng" label="Software engineer way">
    <Admonition type='info'>
      This way allows you to communicate between the rover's onboard computer
      and the Arduino board. However, it takes a bit longer to set up than the
      previous method.

      Following the steps below gives you the ability to use Arduino IDE and
      programming the boards directly from the Leo Rover's on-board computer. This
      means that you won't have to disconnect the board from your computer and connect
      it to the Leo Rover every time you make a small change in the code. However, it
      comes with a drawback of using a less powerful computer to write the code at.
    </Admonition>
    <Admonition type="note">
      If reconnecting the Arduino between your computer and Leo Rover every time you
      make a change to the code is not a problem to you follow The **mechanical
      engineer way** and then skip to Setting up the Rosserial communication.
    </Admonition>

    First connect to the rover via Remote Desktop and connect the rover to the
    network (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

    Now, install and set up Arduino IDE following instructions below:

    Visit [this website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and download the latest
    version of `Arduino IDE`. Make sure to get the **Linux ARM 64 bits** version.

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-ide-linux.webp"
      width="1118"
      height="484"
    />

    Now, you need to extract the .tar file. To do so open new terminal
    (**ctrl+alt+T**) and go to the downloads directory, and unpack the Arduino
    installation files with `tar` command.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    tar -xf arduino-<version>-linuxarm.tar.xz
    ```

    <Admonition type="info">
      Unpacking might take a while, just wait until it's completed.

      Also make note of what Arduino IDE version you are installing as it might be
      different. If you are not sure, what is your file, check the files while being
      in Downloads directory with `ls` command.
    </Admonition>

    You can see the unpacked files in the directory using `ls` command.

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-downloaded.webp"
      width="936"
      height="55"
    />

    Now you need to move extracted files from `Downloads` directory, to `/opt`
    directory. To do so type (while being in Downloads directory):

    ```bash
    sudo mv arduino-<Version> /opt
    ```

    <Admonition type="note">
      When you are using sudo you might get asked for root password. Just type it in,
      and confirm with Enter.
    </Admonition>

    Then you need to install the files. To do so go to the moved Arduino files in
    `/opt` directory and run `install.sh` script.

    <Admonition type="warning">
      Once again pay attention to your Arduino files version, so you go to the correct
      directory. You may also need to give execution rights to `install.sh` script. To
      do so type:

      ```bash
      sudo chmod +x install.sh
      ```
    </Admonition>

    **Arduino IDE** should be installed and you should see new icon on the Desktop.

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-new-icon.webp"
      width="141"
      height="316"
      figStyle={{
        width: 200
      }}
    />

    Now, connect Arduino to the rover. To do so, plug the USB cable in and then,
    open the Arduino IDE.

    After that, set up the board specific options doing the following steps:

    While in IDE, go to: **Tools** -> **Board** -> **Boards Manager**

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-board-manager.webp"
      width="954"
      height="515"
    />

    Type `DUE` in the search bar and install the latest version of
    `Arduino SAM Boards` (32-bits ARM Cortex-M3).

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-board-manager-due.webp"
      width="976"
      height="224"
    />

    The next step is to take care of the board specific setup:

    - Connect the board to a USB port in your computer (use the port closer to the
      barrel jack socket)
    - Go to: **Tools** -> **Board** -> **Arduino ARM (32-bits) Boards** and choose
      **Arduino Due (Programming Port)**

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-programming-port.webp"
      width="955"
      height="515"
    />

    - Go to: **Tools** -> **Port** and choose the port Arduino is connected to

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-programming-port-2.webp"
      width="955"
      height="515"
    />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Checking setup

The easiest way to check if the board is working, is to use pre-created example
codes. One of them is the blink sketch provided in the Arduino IDE examples.

Go to: **File** -> **Examples** -> **01.Basics** and choose the **Blink** sketch

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-blink.webp"
  width="956"
  height="513"
/>

You should see something similar to this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-blink-code.webp"
  width="956"
  height="1035"
/>

Now, you'll have to verify the code and send it to the board. First, make sure
the correct board and ports are chosen as shown below:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-ports.webp"
  width="638"
  height="428"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

Now you can **verify(1)** and **upload(2)** the code.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-verify-upload.webp"
  width="238"
  height="157"
  figStyle={{
    width: 250,
  }}
/>

After a few seconds, you should see two things:

- the following statement:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-upload-done.webp"
  width="377"
  height="163"
  figStyle={{
    width: 350,
  }}
/>

- and Arduino's built-in LED blinking

## Setting up the Rosserial communication

First step is to download the `rosserial` library.

Go to: **Tools** -> **Manage Libraries**

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-manage-libraries.webp"
  width="960"
  height="518"
/>

Type `rosserial` in the search bar and download `Rosserial Arduino Library`

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-search-rosserial.webp"
  width="960"
  height="518"
/>

The board that we are using - `Arduino Due` - needs one additional step in order
to properly work with rosserial.

:::info

Skip this step if you are using another board.

:::

Find `ArduinoHardware.h`. The proper path to find the folder is as follows:

```
/Arduino/libraries/Rosserial_Arduino_Library/src
```

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-hardware-h.webp"
  width="797"
  height="574"
/>

Modify **line 73** to state:

```ino
#if defined(USBCON) and !(defined(USE_USBCON)) and !(defined(_SAM3XA_))
```

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-line-73.webp"
  width="838"
  height="78"
/>

## Examples

From this point forward, most of our instructions will be rephrased instructions
made by `wiki.ros.org`. You can check
[this site](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials) for more detailed
instructions.

In the first tutorial, you can see how to get data from Arduino to the rover`s
mind.

### Arduino Code (hello world - simple publisher)

You can get to the sample code by following the path shown below:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-hello-world.webp"
  width="1600"
  height="869"
/>

Upload the code to Arduino. Make sure to use the correct `PORT` and `BOARD` in
Arduino.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-board-port.webp"
  width="565"
  height="127"
/>

Then, start a new terminal window and launch `rosserial` node, that will start
communication between Arduino and the rover's onboard computer.

```bash
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py port:=/dev/ttyACM0 __name:=my_node
```

:::warning

Remember to set the `port` argument, to the same port you saw in Arduino IDE.

`__name` argument can be set to whatever you like your node to be called

:::

Start another terminal window and check the list of running nodes (you should
see your node there):

```bash
rosnode list
```

You can get more information about your node - eg. what topics it is
listening/publishing to. As you can see, `/Arduino_COM_node` is publishing to
`/chatter` topic

```bash
rosnode info /node_name
```

:::info

After `/`, you need to provide the correct name of your node. You can start
typing the name, and fill the line with **Tab** key (double tap).

:::

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-rosnode-info.webp"
  width="935"
  height="377"
/>

You can also see list of all active topics by typing:

```bash
rostopic list
```

You should see one called `chatter` that was created by Arduino after you've
created the node you've named.

Now to see data published to our topic, type in the terminal:

```bash
rostopic echo /chatter
```

:::info

If everything went according to our plan, by running this command you should be
able to see the Arduino sending “Hello World” message to this topic.

**Ctrl+C** lets you stop the program running in the terminal.

:::

<ImageZoom

  width="937"
  height="455"
/>

### Arduino as publisher and subscriber

In this example, we will show you our real live use case of Arduino with Leo
Rover.

#### Description

Our task was to check whether there is a correlation between soil quality and
motor current in Leo Rover pulling a plow. Therefore we have designed a lowered
plow, capable of gathering pulling force data and drove Leo Rover through soil
of different quality, while gathering the data. And in the end, we could analyze
gathered data.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-plow.webp"
  width="1000"
  height="563"
/>

The Plow is connected to the rest of the rover with a strain gauge beam. Pulling
force can be observed as tiny changes in voltage, that get amplified with an
amplifier. Arduino is used to gather the data and send it to the computer.

:::note

It's obvious that you will not be able to follow this guide with a plow, so you
can replace it with a potentiometer or any other analog sensor. Here are the
instruction, how to connect it, so it works with the rest of the tutorial:

- Connect your sensor to `A0 pin` on Arduino,
- Use 2 LEDs connected to respectively digital pin 10 and digital pin 11
  (remember to use resistors) to test the subscriber part of the code.

:::

#### Code

```arduino
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <ros.h>
#include <std_msgs/Bool.h>
#include <std_msgs/Float32.h>

ros::NodeHandle  nh;

std_msgs::Float32 tension_msg;
std_msgs::Bool plow_state;

void plow_control_callback( const std_msgs::Bool& msg){

  if(msg.data == true){         //plow up
    digitalWrite(10, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(11, LOW);
  }
  else if (msg.data == false)    //plow down
  {
    digitalWrite(10, LOW);
    digitalWrite(11, HIGH);
    }
}

//setup a publisher
ros::Publisher pub_tension("tension", &tension_msg);
//setup a subscriber, make Arduino react to a message with plow_control_callback function
ros::Subscriber<std_msgs::Bool> plow_control ("plow_control", &plow_control_callback );

void setup()
{
  //actuator pins setup
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);

  //rosserial communication setup
  nh.initNode();
  nh.subscribe(plow_control);    //make arduino listen to messages sent to a plow_control top-ic
  nh.advertise(pub_tension);     //give arduino the ability to send messages to pub_tension topic
}
void loop()
{
  //get data and publish it
  tension_msg.data = analogRead(A0);
  pub_tension.publish(&tension_msg);
  nh.spinOnce();
  delay(1);
}
```

#### Running and visualizing

With the code imported to Arduino and all the necessary wires connected, you can
start the Arduino node. To do so, open new terminal and type:

```bash
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM0 __name:=Arduino_node
```

In another terminal run:

```bash
rqt_plot /tension/data
```

You`ll see a graph following the changes in sensor output.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-tension-plot.webp"
  width="605"
  height="367"
/>

Sending either `True` or `False` to `plow_control` topic controls the plow
position for us (either lowered or raised) for you it can control any binary
device e.g. turn the LEDs on and off. You can send those messages by typing in
the terminal:

```bash
rostopic pub /plow_control std_msgs/Bool  „data: false”
```

or:

```bash
rostopic pub /plow_control std_msgs/Bool  „data: true”
```

For instructions related to data recording refer to
[this site](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Tutorials). And If you want to make
recordings easier to use, you can change `.bag` files to `.csv` files by
following [this tutorial](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/rosbag_to_csv).
