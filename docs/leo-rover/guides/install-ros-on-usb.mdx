## Download and flash Ubuntu & ROS image to USB drive

We prepared bootable images with Ubuntu and ROS preinstalled. They support
64-bit architecture and both UEFI and Legacy boot. The images can be found
[here](http://files.fictionlab.pl/ubuntu_ros_images/). Choose either Ubuntu
16.04 with ROS Kinetic or Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic.

You will need a USB drive with at least 8GB storage capacity. To flash the
image, you can follow the same instructions as when flashing Leo Rover image to
SD card:

:::warning

Keep in mind that this will wipe all your data from the drive.

Now, boot your computer from USB drive. Choose the first option in the
`GRUB menu`. User should be automatically logged and desktop environment should
appear.

Ubuntu system password: ubuntu

## Extend your root partition to fill the whole drive

This way your root storage will be extended to full storage capacity of USB
drive - by default it's limited and would end up filling fast with any
additional software installed.

Open terminal (**Ctrl+Shift+T** shortcut) and type:

```bash
sudo ./expand_rootfs.sh
```
