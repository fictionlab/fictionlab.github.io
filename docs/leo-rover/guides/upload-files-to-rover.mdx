## Prerequisites

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/ssh" />

<Tabs groupId='OS'>
    <TabItem value='windows' label='Windows'>

    Download and install [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php).

    Connect to Leo Rover's WiFi.

    Just after you open the software, it will ask you for the rover login details, as always:

    - IP: `10.0.0.1`
    - Login: `pi`
    - Password: `raspberry`

    and click **login**.

    Now in the right window you'll see all the files located in your Leo Rover.

    You can upload files by dragging them from your local computer and dropping them inside Leo Rover's filesystem.

    <TabItem value='linux-macos' label='Linux or macOS'>

        You can use `scp` tool for this. Just type:

        ```bash
        scp [local_path] pi@10.0.0.1:[remote_path]
        ```

        If you want to copy a whole directory you can add `-r` option

        ```bash
        scp -r [local_path] pi@10.0.0.1:[remote_path]
        ```

        <Admonition type="info">
        if `[remote_path]` is a relative path it will be resolved in `/home/pi` namespace (e.g. `pi@10.0.0.1:leo` will be resolved to `/home/pi/leo`).

        To show more options type `man scp`
        </Admonition>

        Alternatively you can use `sshfs` to mount remote file system into your local directory

        ```bash
        mkdir -p [local_path]
        sshfs pi@10.0.0.1:[remote_path] [local_path]
        ```

        Now you can just put files inside `[local_path]` and it will be automatically synchronized with a remote directory.

        When you're done just unmount the directory by typing

        ```bash
        sudo umount [local_path]
        ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## File Permissions

By default, when logging as `pi` user, you have write permission only on files
inside `/home/pi` directory. This should be sufficient in most cases but if you
really need to upload files outside of the home directory you have a couple of
options.

Recommended: take ownership of the directory

First

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/ssh" />

Create a directory if it doesn't exist

```bash
mkdir -p [upload_directory]
```

Now, assign the ownership of that directory

```bash
sudo chown -R pi:pi [upload_directory]
```

This will change ownership of `[upload_directory]` and all files inside it to
`pi` user

### (Not recommended) Upload files by logging into root account

Root logging is disabled by default. If you want to turn this on, you can follow
[these](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/48061) instructions.

You can then get access to all files by logging to `root` instead of `pi`

:::danger

Modifying the root filesystem can be a destructive operation so if you don't
fully understand what you're doing, make sure to backup your files first.
