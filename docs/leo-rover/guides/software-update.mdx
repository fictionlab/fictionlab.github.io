## Flashing a new Raspberry Pi image

### Access microSD charged

To access microSD card from your Leo Rover, open the main electronics box by
unscrewing the 4 socket-headed screws and extract the card from the SD card slot
on the Raspberry Pi.

Put the microSD card in the adapter and then connect it to your computer.

### Download the newest LeoOS image

You can find all releases of LeoOS
[here](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_os/releases). Choose the newest one and
download the image (.img.xz file) you want. We recommend the `full` version. The
`lite` version comes without a desktop environment, so it is an alternative if
you don't need all the extra packages.

### Flash image to microSD card

#### Using Etcher

Open [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) and point it to your new SD card
image location (.img or .img.xz file) via Select image.

Click Select drive option and choose your card, then click Flash!

/>

After the flashing completes, disconnect the card and put it back into the
rover.

#### Using command-line tools

If you are using Linux or Mac, you can use `xz` and `dd` tools to copy
compressed image file into your card like this:

```bash
xz -d -c [IMAGE_FILE] | sudo dd of=[SD_CARD_DEVICE] bs=4M status=progress && sync
```

example usage:

```bash
xz -d -c LeoOS-0.1-2020-06-29-full.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M status=progress && sync
```

:::danger

`dd` can be dangerous to your system as it can wipe your data if used
incorrectly.

If you are not sure your `[SD_CARD_DEVICE]` is correct, we suggest using Etcher
instead.

If you persist on using `dd`, then remember to chose whole disk as your
`[SD_CARD_DEVICE]`, not a partition from this disk. For example, chose
`/dev/sdb`, not `/dev/sdb1`.
