## Flashing a new Raspberry Pi image

### Access microSD charged

To access microSD card from your Leo Rover, open the main electronics box by
unscrewing the 4 socket-headed screws and extract the card from the SD card slot
on the Raspberry Pi.

Put the microSD card in the adapter and then connect it to your computer.

### Download the newest LeoOS image

You can find all releases of LeoOS
[here](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_os/releases). Choose the newest one and
download the image (.img.xz file) you want. We recommend the `full` version. The
`lite` version comes without a desktop environment, so it is an alternative if
you don't need all the extra packages.

### Flash image to microSD card

#### Using Etcher

Open [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) and point it to your new SD card
image location (.img or .img.xz file) via Select image.

Click Select drive option and choose your card, then click Flash!

After the flashing completes, disconnect the card and put it back into the
rover.

#### Using command-line tools

If you are using Linux or Mac, you can use `xz` and `dd` tools to copy
compressed image file into your card like this:

```bash
xz -d -c [IMAGE_FILE] | sudo dd of=[SD_CARD_DEVICE] bs=4M status=progress && sync
```

example usage:

```bash
xz -d -c LeoOS-0.1-2020-06-29-full.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M status=progress && sync
```

:::danger

`dd` can be dangerous to your system as it can wipe your data if used
incorrectly.

If you are not sure your `[SD_CARD_DEVICE]` is correct, we suggest using Etcher
instead.

If you persist on using `dd`, then remember to chose whole disk as your
`[SD_CARD_DEVICE]`, not a partition from this disk. For example, chose
`/dev/sdb`, not `/dev/sdb1`.
