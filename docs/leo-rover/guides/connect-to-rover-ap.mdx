  Learn how to connect to your Leo Rover via WiFi.
---

To connect to Leo Rover, turn it on using its main power button located on the
left side of the battery. The LED on the button should start blinking green.
After ca. 30 s the LED should stop blinking and the Rover should be operational.

Check your host device for the WiFi network. The default credentials should look
like this:

```
SSID: LeoRover-XXXX
Password: password
```

:::note

Instead of the XXXX keyword, you'll see an identifier unique to your Rover's
computer.
