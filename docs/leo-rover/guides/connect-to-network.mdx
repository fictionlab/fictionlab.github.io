When you connect the Rover to your local network that provides Internet
connection, you'll be able to download files to the Rover, as well as forward
the Internet to your computer when you're connected to the Rover's access point.

The LeoOS uses [NetworkManager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager) to
manage the Raspberry Pi's internal Wifi. The Wifi interface can connect to both
2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks.

There are 2 easy ways to connect to an access point:

        Open the `Network Manager Text User Interface` via SSH by typing:

        ```bash
        nmtui
        ```

        />

        Click on the **NetworkManager** applet icon on the systray and choose your network
        (you might need to expand the **More** networks list).
