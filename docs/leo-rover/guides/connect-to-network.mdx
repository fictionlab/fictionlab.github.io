When you connect the Rover to your local network that provides Internet
connection, you'll be able to download files to the Rover, as well as forward
the Internet to your computer when you're connected to the Rover's access point.

The LeoOS uses [NetworkManager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager) to
manage the Raspberry Pi's internal Wifi. The Wifi interface can connect to both
2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks.

There are 2 easy ways to connect to an access point:

    <TabItem value='text' label='Using text interface'>
        Open the `Network Manager Text User Interface` via SSH by typing:

        ```bash
        nmtui
        ```

            figStyle={{
                width: 400,
            }}
        />

        Select `Activate a connection` and choose your network from list below.

            figStyle={{

            }}
        />

        Type in the password when prompted. Press `Esc` to quit.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='rdp' label='Using graphical interface'>

        Use remote desktop to connect to the Rover:

        <LinkButton
            to='remote-desktop'
            title='Connect via remote desktop'
        />
        <br/>

        Click on the **NetworkManager** applet icon on the systray and choose your network
        (you might need to expand the **More** networks list).

            }}
