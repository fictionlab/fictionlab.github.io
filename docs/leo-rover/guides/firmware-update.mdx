## Flashing the newest firmware

You can use the [leo_fw](http://wiki.ros.org/leo_fw) package to flash the newest
firmware from Raspberry Pi without connecting any additional cables. To do this,
login to your Leo Rover.

Make sure you have the latest versions of the packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

And then, run the update script by typing:

```bash
rosrun leo_fw update
```

The script will guide you through the flashing process.

If you are flashing the firmware for the first time, the script won't be able to
determine the board type to flash the correct firmware binary. You will be asked
to manually choose what board you have:

- 1 - for `LeoCore` (the default option - provided in square brackets, after
  prompt)
- 2 - for `Husarion Core2`

If you don't know what your board type is, you need to see it in the Main
Electronics Box. Here are the photos of boards that could be in Leo Rover:

/>

After choosing your option, you will see what the firmware version will be
installed. You need to confirm that you want to flash this firmware, and the
process will start.

If you are just updating the firmware, the script will detect the firmware
version and board type. So, you will only need to confirm that you want to flash
the firmware.
