## Using command line SSH client

If you are using Linux or Mac OS, you most likely have an SSH client already
installed. On Windows 10, you can use this guide to install OpenSSH.

To connect to your Rover, open a terminal session and type:

```bash
ssh pi@10.0.0.1
```

If you log in for the first time, you might see a similar message:

Type `yes` and press enter to continue.
