## Modify the settings

### Change the SSID and password

Modify the `ssid` and `wpa_passphrase` fields.

`ssid` corresponds to the wireless network name (default: `LeoRover-XXXX`) and
`wpa_passphrase` is the network password (default: `password`).

### Change the AP channel

:::tip

This may be useful if you notice the network interference in crowded areas or
you want to use multiple Leo Rovers at once.

:::

Modify the `channel` field.

`channel` corresponds to Leo Rover 2.4 GHz Wifi access point broadcast channel.
You can choose from 1 to 11.

### Set the country code

Modify the `country_code` field

Set to indicate country in which the device is operating (regulatory domain).
The country codes follow the
[ISO 3166-1 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes).

:::warning

This can limit the number of available channels to use.

:::

### Save the changes

Type **Ctrl+O** and **Enter** to save the modified configuration and **Ctrl+X**
to exit the editor.

## Restart the access point

In order to apply the modifications, you need to restart the access point
daemon. To do so, just type:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart hostapd
```
