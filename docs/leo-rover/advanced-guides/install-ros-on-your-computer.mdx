Having ROS on your host machine has many advantages. First of all, it allows you
to communicate with nodes running on your Leo Rover, so it is easier to
introspect ROS network. Also, it lets you run nodes on your computer, so you can
launch part of the node network in your host machine such as graphical
interfaces and visualization tools.

There is a couple of ROS installation options depending on your system:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value='linux' label='Linux Installation'>
        If you have Linux distribution installed (either natively or on virtual machine), you can
        follow instructions on ROS wiki.

        ROS repository contains prebuild packages for ubuntu and debian systems. Melodic distribution
        requires Ubuntu Bionic (18.04 LTS) or Debian Stretch. Noetic requires Ubuntu Focal (20.04 LTS)
        or Debian Buster.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='wsl' label='Windows Subsystem for Linux'>
        Ensure that Windows Subsystem for Linux feature is enabled by opening PowerShell as Administrator
        and running:

        ```powershell
        Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
        ```

        Reboot when prompted.

        Install [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/p/ubuntu-1804-lts/9n9tngvndl3q?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
        from Microsoft Store and open the application.

        You can now follow steps from [ros installation tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
        on ROS wiki.

        To run graphical applications, you need to install X server on Windows. We recommend using
        [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/). Install it and run with default configuration except for
        `Native OpenGL` which should be unchecked (otherwise, `rviz` may fail to launch)

        In your ubuntu session, type:

        ```bash
        echo "export DISPLAY=:0" >> ~/.bashrc
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```

        Now, to test it, run `roscore` on one session and rqt or rviz on another.
