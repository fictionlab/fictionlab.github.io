  Learn how to configure multiple Leo Rovers to communicate on the same network
  and see each other using ROS namespaces and a single ROS master.
---

In this tutorial, we will show you how to configure many rovers in one network,
so that they will see each other and will communicate.

## Prerequisites

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/ssh" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/connect-to-network" />

In such setup, we need every rover, to have its own robot namespace for ROS
nodes and topics, and only one ROS master. We also need to connect all the
rovers to the same network, and know their IP addresses.

Once all rovers are connected to the same network, we can start configuring
them.

:::note

You will need to make almost the same steps on every rover. The only differences
are for the rover with ROS master on it, but it will be marked, how given step
is different for the main rover (the rover with ROS master).

:::

## Getting IP address

First, we need to know the IP address of the rover in the network with all other
rovers. To get it, you have to connect to the rover via ssh, and type in the
terminal

```bash
ip addr
```

This will show addresses assigned to all network interfaces, we just need to
check the correct interface. If you didn't make many changes to the network
setup before, then you need to find the `wlan_int` interface (if you did some
changes and don't have this interface, you need to find the interface connected
to the network). There, you can find the address next to inet tag.

You need to remember or write somewhere this address.

:::info

You need IP address of the main rover for other rovers, so remember specially
what address it has.

## Changing setup file

Now, we need to configure some environment variables. We can do this by changing
the `setup.bash` file in the **/etc/ros** directory. To do so, type:

```bash
nano /etc/ros/setup.bash
```

Here, we need to change a few things:

- make sure the `START_ROSCORE` variable is set to `true` on the main rover, and
  for other rovers it is set to `false`
- uncomment the line with variable `ROS_NAMESPACE`. You also need to provide the
  namespace, it can be `leox`, where x is a number of the rover in your setup,
  or `leo_main` for the main rover. We need to change it, as you can't have two
  nodes with the same name. Setting this variable will give your node name
  prefix with the namespace.
- make sure the line with the `ROS_HOSTNAME` variable is commented
- uncomment the line with the `ROS_IP` variable and provide the IP address of
  the rover
- uncomment the line with the `ROS_MASTER_URI` variable. Now, for the main
  rover, you need to set it to `http://localhost:11311`. For other rovers, you
  need to set it to `http://<ip address of main rover>:11311`

## Changing urdf file

We also need to change the `robot.urdf.xacro` file in the **/etc/ros/urdf**
directory. If we don't make changes in this file, all rovers will have the same
`tf` frames, which will give some error readings when doing something with tf
tree. To edit it, type:

```bash
nano /etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro
```

In this file, you need to provide the `link_prefix` variable. This way we will
have distinct `tf` trees for every rover, as the frames will have the prefix.
You can set it to the same value that you gave to `ROS_NAMESPACE` environment
variable. You can find the `link_prefix` variable inside `xacro:leo` tag.

## Changing launch file

In the previous paragraph, we were making changes required for working `tf`
tree, but those changes were not enough. We also need to change the
`robot.launch` file in **/etc/ros** directory, to make it work correctly. To
edit it, type:

```bash
nano /etc/ros/robot.launch
```

In this file, we include another launch file. The included launch file has ros
argument `tf_frame_prefix`, so we can set it here in the `<include>` tag, to our
value. To add it, you need to include this line in the file:

```xml
<arg name="tf_frame_prefix" value="leo_main/"/>
```

Your `robot.launch` file in the end should look like this:

```xml title="/etc/ros/robot.launch"
<launch>

  <param name="robot_description"
         command="xacro /etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro"/>

  <include file="$(find leo_bringup)/launch/leo_bringup.launch">
    <arg name="upload_description" value="false"/>
    <arg name="tf_frame_prefix" value="leo_main/"/>
  </include>

</launch>
```

:::warning

You need to set the value of `tf_frame_prefix `argument in the `robot.launch`
file to the same value, you gave in the `link_prefix` variable in
`robot.urdf.xacro` file.
