  Get started with ROS 2 on your Leo Rover by flashing the experimental LeoOS
  image. Find out about the necessary firmware updates and configuration steps.
---

:::warning

ROS 2 support on Leo Rover is still experimental. Expect missing features,
broken integrations etc.

:::

## Prerequisites

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/connect-to-rover-ap" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/ssh" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/software-update" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/firmware-update" />

## How to use

To use Leo Rover with ROS 2, you need to flash the experimental
[LeoOS with ROS 2 support](https://github.com/LeoRover/LeoOS-ros2/releases).
Download either the `lite` or `full` version and flash the image onto the SD
card:

<LinkButton
  to="/leo-rover/guides/software-update#flashing-a-new-raspberry-pi-image"
  title="Flashing a new Raspberry Pi image"
/>

After starting the robot, connect to the Rover AP and login to Raspberry Pi via
SSH:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/connect-to-rover-ap" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/ssh" />

The ROS 2 version requires different firmware for the motor controller. To
firmware update process looks almost exactly the same as it was before:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/firmware-update" />

The only difference is that to invoke the update script, you need to type:

```bash
ros2 run leo_fw update
```

## Changes

The experimental OS functions very similarly to the current stable release of
LeoOS. The network configuration works the same, no new system services are
started, even the ROS API is almost identical. There are, however, a few
changes, apart from the ROS distribution, that should be taken into account:

### Micro-ROS instead of ROSSerial

As ROSSerial project is not available for ROS 2, we had to find another protocol
for serial communication between Raspberry Pi and the motor controller. Thus,
[the new firmware](https://github.com/LeoRover/leocore_firmware_ros2/) utilizes
the [Micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/) project to expose the ROS topics and
services via the [Micro-ROS Agent](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS-Agent)
running on the Raspberry Pi.

### New systemd user services

Instead of one system service `leo` which started the ROS functionality, the new
OS provides two **user** services:

- **ros-nodes** - Starts the `/etc/ros/robot.launch.xml` ROS 2 launch file.
- **uros-agent** - Starts the
  [Micro-ROS Agent](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS-Agent).

Both of these services can be configured through the `/etc/ros/setup.bash` file.

To facilitate the process of managing these services, we developed a set of bash
[aliases](https://github.com/LeoRover/LeoOS-ros2/blob/b593ba85a871ce906881052586bd988cd9fd16dc/stage3/03-leo-ros/files/aliases).
For example, to stop both services, you can type:

```bash
ros-nodes-stop
uros-agent-stop
```

### v4l2_camera instead of raspicam_node

Due to the Raspberry Pi MMAL libraries
[no longer being supported](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland/issues/688)
on 64 bit systems, we were unable to port
[raspicam_node](https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/raspicam_node) to ROS2
Humble. Instead, we switched to using
[v4l2_camera](https://gitlab.com/boldhearts/ros2_v4l2_camera) to expose the
camera images on ROS topics.

### image_proc nodes running by default

As an experimental feature, we added
[image_proc](https://wiki.ros.org/image_proc) debayer and rectify nodes that are
running by default. They add the following topics:

```bash
/camera/image_mono
/camera/image_color
/camera/image_rect
/camera/image_rect_color
```

### RDP no longer supported

Due to the fact that
[tigervnc-scraping-server](https://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/tigervnc-scraping-server.html)
seems to work a lot faster than [xrdp](http://xrdp.org/) and allows utilizing
hardware acceleration, we decided to drop support for remote desktop via RDP
protocol. The new OS, by default, only allows remote desktop connections via VNC
protocol.

## Current limitations

Because of the new architecture, some new problems, that limit some
functionalities of the robot, were introduced. We are actively trying to
mitigate them but you should take them into account for now.

### No way to permanently change firmware parameters

The ROSSerial-based firmware was retrieving parameter values from the
[Parameter Server](http://wiki.ros.org/Parameter%20Server) during
initialization. This allowed to change the firmware parameters from Raspberry Pi
and make the changes persistent across reboots. As ROS 2 does not have a global
parameter server, the new firmware loses this ability.

:::tip

The new firmware allows changing parameters at runtime via, for example,
[rqt_reconfigure](https://index.ros.org/p/rqt_reconfigure/) tool.

:::

### Not compatible software integrations

If you used any of our [integrations](/category/integrations) guides, you will
have to adapt the software integration parts yourself. In some cases, it won't
be possible due to missing ROS 2 packages.

### Problems with multi-robot setups

The ROS namespace and domain id of the firmware node (the ROS node running on
the motor controller) is currently hardcoded and there's no way to change it
without changing firmware code and re-flashing the board. This makes it a lot
harder to work with multi-robot setups due to topic name collisions.
