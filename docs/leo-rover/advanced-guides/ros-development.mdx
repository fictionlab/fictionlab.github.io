ROS will give us the possibility to write and run different processes (called
[nodes](http://wiki.ros.org/Nodes)) that communicate with each other by sending
and receiving messages on named buses (called
[topics](http://wiki.ros.org/Topics)) or by calling remote procedures (called
[services](http://wiki.ros.org/Services)). Please read the
[ROS/Concepts Wiki page](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Concepts) to get a more clear
overview of the concepts related to ROS.

This section will describe some basic ROS functionality that can be accomplished
with stock Leo Rover.

## Prerequisites

## Introspecting ROS network with command line tools

ROS comes with some command line tools that can help to introspect the current
network of running nodes. Some of the available tools are as follows:

- [rosnode](http://wiki.ros.org/rosnode) - printing information about currently
  running nodes, killing them, testing connectivity,
- [rostopic](http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic) - listing and printing information
  about topics currently in use, printing published messages, publishing data to
  topics, finding a type of published messages
- [rosservice](http://wiki.ros.org/rosservice) - listing and printing
  information about available services, calling the service with provided
  arguments,
- [rosmsg](http://wiki.ros.org/rosmsg#rosmsg-1) - displaying the fields of a
  specified ROS message type.

Let's try running some examples. Before that, connect to Leo Rover via SSH.

Start by reading currently running nodes:

```bash
rosnode list
```

You should see most of all the nodes described in the
[first section](/leo-rover/documentation/specification#software-structure) of
this tutorial. Among them, the rosserial server node (called `/serial_node` in
this case) "bridges" communication with the CORE2 board, so any topics it
publishes or subscribes are created and used in the firmware.

Let's get more information about this node:

```bash
rosnode info /serial_node
```

You should see all the subscribed, published topics and services that the
firmware provides. You can learn more about each topic in
[leo_firmware README page](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_firmware/blob/master/README.md).

Among published topics, you should see the `/battery` topic. Let's read the
published values using `rostopic` tool:

```bash
rostopic echo /firmware/battery
```

Now, let's look at the `/cmd_vel` topic. This topic is used by the firmware to
receive drive commands. We can look at its type:

```bash
rostopic type /cmd_vel
```

You should get `geometry_msgs/Twist`. This is a standard message in ROS for
commanding velocity controlled ground robots. We can look up the message
description using `rosmsg` tool:

```bash
rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist
```

The description should look like this:

```bash
geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
```

The `linear` field represents linear velocity (in meters per second) along x, y,
z axes. `angular` field represents angular velocity (in radians per second)
along the same axes.

:::info

You can read more about standard units of measure and coordinate conventions in
[REP103](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html)

:::

For differential drive robots like Leo Rover, only `linear.x` and `angular.z`
values are used.

We can use `rostopic` tool to actually command the rover to move forward, by
sending messages to `/cmd_vel` topic:

```bash
rostopic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- "linear: {x: 0.2}"
```

The rover should start moving forward with a velocity of 0.2 m/s. To stop
message publishing, simply type **Ctrl+C**.

> The -r 10 argument tells the rostopic tool to publish the message repeatedly
> 10 times per second instead of publishing only one message. This is necessary
> because the firmware implements a timeout that will stop the rover if it
> doesn't receive the next command after some time (half a second by default).

## Using ROS client library to publish messages

ROS provides several client libraries that let you write ROS nodes in different
languages. The most common ones are [roscpp](http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp) for C++
and [rospy](http://wiki.ros.org/rospy) for Python.

Here is a simple Python node that commands the rover by publishing to `/cmd_vel`
topic:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

# Initialize ROS node
rospy.init_node("test_drive")

# Create ROS publisher
cmd_pub = rospy.Publisher("cmd_vel", Twist, queue_size=1)

# Write a function that drives the Rover with specified
# linear and angular speed for 2 seconds
def drive(linear, angular):
    # Initialize ROS message object
    twist = Twist()
    twist.linear.x = linear
    twist.angular.z = angular

    for _ in range(20): # repeat 20 times
        cmd_pub.publish(twist) # publish message
        rospy.sleep(0.1) # sleep for 100ms

# Now let's actually test driving the Rover
# linear speed is in m/s and angular speed in rad/s
drive(0.2, 0.0)
drive(0.0, 0.0)
drive(-0.2, 0.0)
drive(0.0, 0.0)
drive(0.0, 1.0)
drive(0.0, 0.0)
drive(0.0, -1.0)
drive(0.0, 0.0)
```

Copy this script to Raspberry Pi filesystem.

:::info

You can paste this to new file when using a terminal. Copy the script to
clipboard, then type:

```bash
cat > test_drive.py
```

Type **Ctrl+Shift+V** when using Linux terminal or **Shift+Ins** when using
Putty. Then type **Ctrl+D** to end the file.

:::

Add execute permission to the file:

```bash
chmod +x test_drive.py
```

And execute it by typing:

```bash
./test_drive.py
```

The rover should drive forward and backward, then, turn in place in left and
right directions.

:::warning

Make sure you don't have a Web UI running at the moment as it may cause
conflicts on /cmd_vel topic

:::

## Adding additional functionality to the rover

LeoOS provides an easy mechanism for adding new functionalities without building
any of the base packages. The whole process of starting the ROS nodes at boot
can be summarized by the following files:

- **/etc/ros/robot.launch** - a `launch file` that starts the robot's
  functionality. It includes the launch file from the
  [leo_bringup](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_bringup) package which starts
  the base functionality of the rover, but also allows to add additional nodes
  to be started or parameters to be set on the Parameter Server.

:::info

A [launch file](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML) is an XML file that describes
a set of nodes to be stared with specified parameters. It can be interpreted
with [roslaunch](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch) tool.

:::

- **/etc/ros/setup.bash** - the environment setup file that sets all the
  environment variables necessary for the successful start of the ROS nodes. It
  sources the environment setup file from the target ROS distribution (by
  default `/opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash`) and sets additional
  [environment variables used by ROS.](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables)
- **/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro** - the URDF description (in
  [xacro](http://wiki.ros.org/xacro) format) that is uploaded to the Parameter
  Server by the `robot.launch` file. It includes the robot's model from the
  [leo_description](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_description) package, but
  also allows to add additional links or joints to the model.
- **/usr/bin/leo-start** - a script that starts the robot's functionality. In
  short, it sources the `/etc/ros/setup.bash` file and launches the
  `/etc/ros/robot.launch` file.
- **/usr/bin/leo-stop** - a script that stops the currently running `leo-start`
  process.

On top of that, the `leo` systemd service starts the `leo-start` script when the
computer boots.

### Starting the functionality manually

To start the nodes manually, first, you need to stop the ones that are currently
running. You can do this either by using the `leo-stop` script:

```bash
leo-stop
```

or by stopping the `leo` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop leo
```

If you wish to disable the service from starting at boot, you can type:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable leo
```

To turn the service back on, just type:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable leo
```

Now, to start the nodes manually, type:

```bash
leo-start
```

Type **Ctrl+C** to stop the nodes and exit the script.

### Adding additional nodes to the launch file

To add additional nodes to be started, you can modify the
`/etc/ros/robot.launch` file. Take a look at the
[launch file XML specification](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML) (especially
the [node](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/node) and
[param](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/param) tags) for reference.

Here's an example that uses `node` and `param` tags:

```xml
<param name="name_of_the_global_parameter"
       value="value_of_the_parameter"/>

<node name="name_of_the_node"
      pkg="name_of_the_package"
      type="name_of_the_executable">

      <param name="name_of_the_private_parameter"
             value="value_of_the_parameter"/>
</node>
```

Modify it to your needs, add it to the `/etc/ros/robot.launch` file and restart
the nodes.

If you want your additional functionality to be easily switchable, you can put
these lines, embedded into `<launch>` tag, into a separate file (e.g.
`/etc/ros/function1.launch`) and add these lines to the `/etc/ros/robot.launch`
file:

```xml title="/etc/ros/robot.launch"
<include if="$(optenv USE_FUNCTION1 false)"
         file="/etc/ros/function1.launch"/>
```

Then, add this line to the `/etc/ros/setup.bash` file:

```bash title="/etc/ros/setup.bash"
export USE_FUNCTION1=true
```

Now, you can toggle the functionality simply by changing the `USE_FUNCTION1`
environment variable and restarting the nodes.

### Expanding the URDF model

When integrating a sensor or other device to your rover, you might sometimes
want to extend the robot's URDF model to:

- visualize the device attached to the rover in RViz
- make the robot aware of device's collision geometry
- provide additional reference frames (for example for the sensor readings)

You can create a separate URDF file for your attached device like this one:

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/sensor.urdf.xacro"
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot>
  <!-- a link representing visual and collision
       properties of the sensor -->
  <link name="sensor_base_link">
    <visual>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.05"/>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.05 0.05 0.1"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="red">
        <color rgba="1 0 0 0.7"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.05"/>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.05 0.05 0.1"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
  </link>

  <!-- fixed joint that attaches
       the sensor to the rover's body -->
  <joint name="sensor_base_joint" type="fixed">
    <origin xyz="0.08 0 0"/>
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="sensor_base_link"/>
  </joint>

  <!-- reference frame for sensor readings -->
  <link name="sensor_frame"/>

  <!-- fixed joint that sets the origin
       of the reference frame -->
  <joint name="sensor_joint" type="fixed">
    <origin xyz="0 0 0.06"/>
    <parent link="sensor_base_link"/>
    <child link="sensor_frame"/>
  </joint>

</robot>
```

And include it in the robot's main URDF file by adding:

```xml title="/etc/ros/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro"
<xacro:include filename="/etc/ros/urdf/sensor.urdf.xacro"/>
```

Now, when you restart the nodes, a new URDF model should be uploaded to the
Parameter Server and you should be able to view the new model in RViz.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/guides/ros-development/sensor-rviz.webp"
  alt="RViz window showing added sensor to the model"
  width="769"
  height="591"
  figStyle={{
    width: 400,
  }}
/>

You can use `base_link` as a reference frame for other links in the model. The
exact position of the `base_link` origin is defined as the center of this
mounting hole on the upper plane of the mounting plate:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/guides/ros-development/base-link.webp"
  alt="Base link location shown inside RViz"
  width="1105"
  height="737"
  figStyle={{
    width: 400,
  }}
/>

The distance can be easily measured in CAD programs or even using physical
measuring tools.

## Building additional ROS packages

ROS uses its own build system for building packages. To learn about it, read the
[catkin/conceptual_overview](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/conceptual_overview) and
[catkin/workspaces](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces) ROS wiki pages.
Here's a brief summary:

> The packages are the main unit for organizing software in ROS. The current
> build system used to build ROS packages is
> [catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin). Catkin packages can be built as a
> standalone project, but the system also provides the concept of
> [workspaces](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces).

> When building a catkin workspace, the install targets are placed into an
> [FHS compliant](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0122.html) hierarchy inside the
> [result space](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces#Result_space). A set of
> [environment setup files](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces#Environment_Setup_File)
> allow extending your shell environment, so that you can find and use any
> resources that have been installed to that location.

:::info

The prebuilt ROS packages (installed from the repository) are placed into
`/opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}` directory. To use the environment setup file, just
type:

```bash
source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
```

If you use LeoOS, this line is already added to `~/.bashrc` file, so it will be
automatically executed when you log into the terminal session.

:::

> The catkin build system also supports an
> [overlay](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces#Overlays) mechanism, where one
> workspace can extend another result space. An `environment setup file` from
> the result space of such workspace will extend your shell environment by
> packages from both workspaces.

> The build system provides a
> [catkin_make](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/commands/catkin_make) command for
> building workspaces, but we will use `catkin` command line tool from Python
> package [catkin-tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as it
> delivers more user-friendly and robust environment for building catkin
> packages.

In this chapter, we will try to:

- create workspace that extends your ROS distribution
- add [leo_robot](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_robot) to this workspace and
  build the packages
- modify the `/etc/ros/setup.bash` file to use our overlay

Let's start by creating an empty workspace inside home directory on Raspberry
Pi:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src
cd ~/ros_ws
catkin init
```

We want this workspace to extend the prebuilt packages that are already
installed on the system. It should be automatically done if you have already
sourced the `/opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash` file, but we can also explicitly
point out the space to extend:

```bash
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}
```

We need to get the sources of the package to build. If the package is available
as a git repository (like in our case), you can use the `git clone` command:

```bash
cd src
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_robot.git
```

Some of the packages will require installing additional dependencies to build
and run them. As the `leo_bringup` package is already installed on the system,
this step is redundant. For any other package, you can use `rosdep` to
automatically install any dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src -iy
```

Build the workspace:

```bash
catkin build
```

If everything works, a
[development space](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces#Development_.28Devel.29_Space)
should be created inside the devel directory. Let's source the environment setup
file inside it:

```bash
source ~/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

Now, when you execute `rospack list`, you should see all of the packages
installed on your system, but `rospack find leo_bringup` should point you to the
directory on your newly created workspace.

The last step is to modify `/etc/ros/setup.bash` to use our overlay. Simply edit
this file (e.g. with `nano`) by removing or commenting out the first line and
adding:

```bash title="/etc/ros/setup.bash"
# source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
source /home/pi/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

When you start the nodes with the `leo-start` script, `/etc/ros/setup.bash` will
use your overlay and the /etc/ros/robot.launch file should use the version of
`leo_robot` that you have built in your workspace.

## Connecting another computer to ROS network

ROS is designed with distributed computing in mind. The nodes make no assumption
about where in the network they run. Configuring your computer to be able to
communicate with ROS network will let you run nodes that interfere with Leo
Rover's hardware, as well as graphical tools (like rqt or rviz) directly on your
host machine.

To install ROS on your computer, you can follow this tutorial:

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/install-ros-on-your-computer" />

In this section, we will assume you run Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic.

First, connect your computer to the same network your rover is connected to. It
can be either the Rover's Access Point (`LeoRover-XXXX` by default) or an
external router (if you followed
[Connect to the Internet tutorial](/leo-rover/guides/connect-to-network)).

To properly communicate over the ROS network, your computer needs to be able to
resolve the master.lan hostname. Open a terminal on your computer and type:

```bash
getent hosts master.lan
```

If you don't see any output, that means you cannot resolve the hostname.

If you are connected to Rover's Access Point, you should be able to resolve it,
but if there is an issue with DNS server on the rover or you are connected
through external router, add this line to the `/etc/hosts` file on your
computer:

```bash
10.0.0.1 master.lan
```

:::warning

If you are connected through router, you need to change `10.0.0.1` to IP address
of the Rover on your local network.

:::

If everything works, you should be able to ping the rover by it's hostname. To
check it, type: `ping master.lan`.

Now, to be connected in ROS network, you need to set some environment variables.
Start by sourcing the result space you are using:

```bash
source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
```

Specify the address of the master node:

```bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://master.lan:11311
```

And your IP on the network:

```bash
export ROS_IP=X.X.X.X
```

Replace `X.X.X.X` with your IP address.

:::tip

You can check your address by typing `ip address`. Search for your wireless
network interface and the `inet` keyword.

:::

You will need these lines executed at every terminal session you want to use ROS
on. To do this automatically at the start of every session, you can add this
line to the `~/.bashrc` file.

You should now be able to do all the things from `the first section` of this
tutorial on your computer.

## Examples of ROS use

Apart from allowing communication between different processes on Raspberry Pi,
ROS will give us the possibility to remotely control the rover on your computer,
as well as run graphical tools to introspect and visualize the current state of
the rover. A lot of these tools are available in distribution packages in the
form of [rqt](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt) and [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz)
plugins.

Below, are some examples possible to do on the stock Leo Rover:
