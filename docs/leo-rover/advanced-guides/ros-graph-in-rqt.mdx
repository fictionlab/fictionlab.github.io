This tutorial is devoted to introspecting the ROS computation graph in RQT. But
what is the rqt graph in the first place?

## Prerequisites

## RQT graph

RQT graph is a tool that comes in handy during your ROS development. It's based
on the Qt framework.

The numerous rqt plugins the tool consists of will help you in ROS debugging and
visualizing the computation graph.

When programming with ROS, you typically arrange your work into packages and
nodes. As your application grows, your codebase does as well.

You'll be getting more and more nodes, with more and more communication between
them (services, topics, actions). Also, you'll use already existing ROS nodes in
your application, which is one of the advantages of ROS.

## How to install rqt plugin

A [node graph](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph) is an rqt plugin that can
visualize ROS computation graph. It is a very handy tool for debugging
communication problems.

First, make sure you have the plugin installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rqt-graph
```

### Launching RQT

Start rqt by typing:

```bash
rqt
```

Now, choose Plugins -> Introspection -> Node Graph

If you are connected to your rover, you should see all the nodes running on
Raspberry Pi. You can experiment with Node Graph settings, so it can look like
this:

### Rqt plot

`Rgt_plot` allows you to plot any numeric values that ROS topics publish and
have many plots within the same graph.

That's an excellent solution to visually keep track of the data created by a
node or many nodes. For instance, it enables you to plot the
speed/acceleration/position of your mobile base to check for a potential jerk
and see if the trajectory is smooth. You could also monitor the data of the
temperature sensor to see any increasing value, etc.
