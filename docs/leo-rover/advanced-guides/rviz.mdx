  Learn how to visualize the Leo Rover model using RViz, including instructions
  for setting up the necessary packages and launching the visualization.

## Prerequisites

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

## Installation

To visualize the model, you will need 2 additional packages:

- [leo_description](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_description) - contains the
  URDF model of Leo Rover with all the required mesh files.
- [leo_viz](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_viz) - contains visualization launch
  files and RViz configurations for Leo Rover.

You can build them using the instructions from
[this chapter](ros-development#building-additional-ros-packages). You can also
download the prebuilt packages from the ROS repository by executing:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-leo-viz
```

## Launch

Now, to visualize the model in RViz, just type:

```bash
roslaunch leo_viz rviz.launch
```

<ImageZoom

  alt="RVIZ window"
  width="1200"
  height="707"
  figStyle={{
    width: 400,
  }}
/>

Alternatively, you can open a fresh instance of RViz by typing:

```bash
rviz
```

In the **Fixed Frame** option choose base_link.

<ImageZoom

  alt="Location of Fixed Frame option"
  width="1365"
  height="728"
  figStyle={{
    width: 400,
  }}
/>

In **Displays** panel, click **Add** and choose **RobotModel** plugin.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/guides/rviz/rviz-add-robot-model.webp"
  alt="Location of Add RobotModel option"
  width="1364"
  height="728"
  figStyle={{
    width: 400,
  }}
/>

Change the **Background Color** to make the model more visible.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/guides/rviz/rviz-change-background.webp"
  alt="Location of Background change option"
  width="1364"
  height="728"
  figStyle={{
    width: 400,
  }}
/>

You should see the wheels rotating when the Rover is being steered.

## Running the visualization offline

You can run the visualization without being connected to the Rover. For this,
you will need to change environment variables to point to your loopback device:

```bash
export ROS_IP=127.0.0.1
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://127.0.0.1:11311
```

Then, use the launch file located in the `leo_viz` package:

```bash
roslaunch leo_viz view_model.launch
```

:::info

[roslaunch](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch) will automatically spawn the Master
node ([roscore](http://wiki.ros.org/roscore)) if it detects that it is not
already running.

:::

An RViz instance with `RobotModel` plugin should start, as well as GUI for
[joint_state_publisher](http://wiki.ros.org/joint_state_publisher) that let's
you specify simulated wheel positions.
