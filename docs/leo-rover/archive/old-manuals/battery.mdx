The button terminals may look different depending on a batch of components we
get. When there's no marking on the left and right terminals, connect green LED
wire to the left (number 1) terminal and the black negative wire to the right
(number 2). There is a photo lower on the site showing the correct connections
for the other type of button commonly used in our Leo Rover.
