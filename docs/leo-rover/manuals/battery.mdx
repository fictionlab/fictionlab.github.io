:::info

The button terminals may look different depending on a batch of components we get.
When there's no marking on the left and right terminals, connect green LED wire to the left
(number 1) terminal and the black negative wire to the right (number 2).
There is a photo lower on the site showing the correct connections for the other type of
button commonly used in our Leo Rover.
