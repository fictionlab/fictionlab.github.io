A line follower example for stock Leo Rover

In this example, we will show you how to run a line follower on the Leo Rover
mobile robot.

## What to expect?

After completing this tutorial, your rover should be able to navigate a
two-lined track by itself. You will also be able to gather and train neural
network model for this task on your own data. Here's an example of our rover
driving on the designated track:

<div className="video-container">
  <LiteYouTubeEmbed
    id="ZecYe0FAh48"
    params="autoplay=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0"

</div>

## Prerequisites

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/connect-to-rover-ap" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/ssh" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/joystick" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/install-ros-on-your-computer" />

## List of components

### General requirements

1. Basic knowledge about `ROS` (e.g how to run nodes, `roslaunch` and `rosrun`
   commands)
2. Computer with Linux OS with `ROS` installed
3. Stock Leo Rover

### For running our model (driving rover on track)

1. Insulating tape of any color (the more contrast with the ground, the better)

### For gathering and training on your data

1. Account on a website providing online environment for Jupyter Notebooks (we
   have used [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/))
2. Game pad for gathering the data **(not needed but recommended)**

## Mechanical integration

As this is one of our examples for stock Leo Rover, you don't have to do any
mechanical stuff regarding the rover. The only "mechanical" thing you need to do
is to make a two-lined track with insulating tape. Below, there's an example of
our track that we used for training the neural network model - image taken from
the rover. Try to end up with something like this:

- two lines far enough from each other, so that the rover can drive in between
- color of the lines different from the ground

<ImageZoom

  height="480"
/>

:::info

Actually you don't need to use insulating tape. As you will learn later in the
tutorial, you only need to provide two lines for the rover, which have different
color than the ground. So for example one solution is drawing/printing the lines
on paper and stick it to the ground with adhesive tape.

:::

## Software integration

:::tip

Since LeoOS 1.1.0 release, leo_examples package is installed by default. If the
system is updated to at least 1.1.0 release you can skip software integration
part.

:::

:::info

To complete those steps, you need to connect to the rover's network first, and
then log in using ssh (both covered in prerequisites).

:::

:::info

One package in the _leo_examples_ repository depends on _ar_track_alvar_
package. As there is no release for the _ROS_ version running on the rover
(noetic) yet, you have to install it manually. To do so, type:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-ar-track-alvar
```

:::

Our neural network model was converted to
[TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite), so you need to install it on
your rover too:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install tflite-runtime
```

### Installing using apt

You can install the package using `apt` by typing **on the rover**:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-leo-examples
```

Then you just need to source the `ROS` workspace:

```bash
source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
```

### Building from source

You can also get all needed software from our
[leo_examples](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_examples) github repository. You
need to clone it on the rover in the ros workspace directory (if there's no such
a directory, then, first go through the
[ROS Development](/leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development) tutorial):

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_examples.git
```

Now, you need to install all the dependencies for the downloaded packages:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src -i
```

Then, you need to source the directory and build the packages:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
source devel/setup.bash
catkin build
```

:::info

If your installation went without any errors, then you have successfully
installed required software.

:::

## Examples

### Running nodes

#### Color Mask

Our approach for this task was to get the specified color from the image (color
of the tape), and train the neural network on such a mask.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/line-follower/line-follower-2.webp"
  alt="example color mask from our track"
  width="288"
  height="215"
  figStyle={{
    width: 400,
  }}
/>

So, the first thing you need to do is to get the color mask values. We have
prepared ROS node for this task. To run it, type in the terminal on the rover:

```bash
roslaunch leo_example_line_follower color_mask.launch
```

Then, on your computer, you need to go to your ROS workspace, source it and
export ROS environment variables to be able to run ROS nodes on your computer
with master being on the rover:

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros_workspace>
source devel/setup.bash
export ROS_IP=<your_ip_address_in_the_rovers_network>
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://master.localnet:11311
```

Now, with the `color_mask` node running on the rover, run rqt on your computer
to be able to visualize the color mask and choose the values:

```bash
rqt
```

Now, run in rqt:

- `Image View` (Plugins -> Visualization -> Image View)
- `Dynamic Reconfigure` (Plugins -> Configuration -> Dynamic Reconfigure)

In `Image View`, from the topic drop down choose /color_mask topic - this is the
live view of the color mask sampled from the rover's view with current values
for the color mask.

In `Dynamic Reconfigure`, choose `color_mask_finder`. You'll see something like
this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/line-follower/line-follower-3.webp"
  alt="rqt setup for choosing color mask"
  width="1362"
  height="729"
/>

The sliders are for choosing `HSV` min and max values (2 sliders per hue,
saturation and value). You can adjust those sliders to change the color mask. If
you want to see what colors are currently in the mask, switch the topic in the
image view to `/cached_colors/compressed`.

:::note

- When choosing the color mask values from scratch, start by moving all MIN
  sliders to 0, and all MAX sliders, to maximum values. Then adjust the sliders
  one by one, until the only white thing in the mask is your track (tape). Color
  mask visible in rqt is already the image that will be fed to neural network -
  image is already preprocessed (cropped, etc.)
- starting values in the dynamic reconfigure are loaded from the yaml file from
  _config_ directory (default is _blue.yaml_) which you can specify with ROS
  launch argument file providing path to the yaml file (you just need to add to
  the _roslaunch_ command _file:=\<path>_).
- The node supports overlapping of hue interval (setting hue_max < hue_min). In
  such situation, your final mask is an union of two masks, where one has hue
  values from interval \[0, hue_max\] and the other has values from interval
  \[hue_min, 179\] (such solution is useful for catching colors with wide hue
  spectrum - e.g. red)

:::

When you are satisfied with your color mask, you can stop both rqt and the node
(with **ctrl+c**). Your chosen values will be printed in the terminal.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/line-follower/line-follower-4.webp"
  alt="terminal"
  width="516"
  height="218"
/>

You need to save them in the yaml file (best if you place it in the config
directory of the leo_example_line_follower package). You can do this with nano.
Copy the printed values (using the mouse or **ctrl+shift+c**) and type on the
rover

```bash
touch ~/ros_ws/src/leo_examples/leo_example_line_follower/config/my_mask.yaml
nano ~/ros_ws/src/leo_examples/leo_example_line_follower/config/my_mask.yaml
```

Then, paste the values (**ctrl+shift+v** or use the mouse), save the file
(**ctrl+o**) and close it (**ctrl+x**).

#### Line Follower

Running the model is really simple. Just put the rover on the track, and write
in terminal (on the rover)

```bash
roslaunch leo_example_line_follower line_follower.launch
```

But there are a few `roslaunch` arguments provided to run the model with your
data (e.g. color mask).

The most important ones are as follows:

- `color_mask_file` - path to file with the color mask (HSV) values
- `pub_mask` - flag specifying whether or not to publish color mask while
  driving (might slow the payload but useful for debugging)
- `model` - path to neural network model (there is a `models` directory with
  couple models prepared by us, which you can choose from)

Every argument is documented, you can see all arguments and the documentation by
running:

```bash
roslaunch leo_example_line_follower line_follower.launch --ros-args
```

:::note

Every argument has default value, so you don't need to enter every argument when
running the line follower.

When you want to change the value for specific argument, you can do this by
adding to the command _\<arg_name>:=\<value>_.

:::

:::warning

Remember that due to light reflection from the ground, the rover won't stay on
the track forever, so make sure you are ready to stop it, or help it, when it
goes off the track.

:::

## What next?

### Making your own model

#### Gathering data

For gathering the data, you'll need to run our node `data_saver.py`. You need to
run it on the rover by using the `roslaunch` command.

The node has one required argument - `duration` which specifies how long (in
seconds) the data will be recorded. You can also specify the output directory
for the recorded data using the `output_dir` argument. So, for example, your
command can look like this:

```bash
roslaunch leo_example_line_follower record_data.launch duration:=30 output_dir:=test_drive
```

This will record data for 30 seconds and place all the recorded data in the
`test_drive` directory (the node will create the directory if it doesn't exist).

:::tip

You don't have to record all the data into one directory. You can record the
data to many directories, as you will need to process them later anyway. So you
can run this command multiple times with changed arguments.

:::

First, the node waits for `twist` messages from `/cmd_vel` topic, and after it
gets any message from this topic, it'll start recording data (the only data that
will be recorded is when the rover is moving - if you're staying in place, no
data will be recorded).

After recording the data, in your output directory, you'll find images saved
from the rover, and one file `labels.txt`. The file contains multiple lines of
format `img_name:label`, where the label is a tuple of two floats representing
linear and angular (respectively) speeds of the rover in the situation visible
in the specified image.

:::note

This is the only part, where you might need game controller. It's just easier to
drive over track, and stay in the lines - collect good data for the neural
network - with game controller, than the joystick on the web page, but you can
still do this using the Leo UI.

:::

:::warning

If the name for output directory, that you have provided is not an absolute path
(starting with "/"), the directory will be put under home directory (by default
_/home/pi_). If you want it to be somewhere else, you need to give the absolute
path.

:::

#### Preparing the data

When you have your data recorded, you have to collect it in the correct
structure. To do so, you need to run our `prepare_data.py` node with the
`rosrun` command.

The node has three flags which you have to specify:

- `-t / --train_data` - paths to directories with data for training the neural
  network
- `-v / --valid_data` - paths to directories with data for validation during the
  training
- `-z / --zip_file` - name of the zip file with your data that will be created
  in the end

So, for example, your command can look like this (if you're running it in the
home directory):

```bash
rosrun leo_example_line_follower prepare_data.py -t train_dir1 train_dir2 -v val1 val2 -z my_dataset.zip
```

:::warning

Unlike roslaunch, rosrun commands run in your current working directory, so for
example: \
If you run the node in /home/pi/test directory and provide names for the -t and -v
flags as train and valid, then the node will look for /home/pi/test/train and /home/pi/test/valid
directories.

:::

After running this node, in the same directory, you'll have your zip file with
the processed data that is ready to upload to your notebook.

:::note

As we have used kaggle, we know that providing zip file is enough for the
dataset as it get's unpacked automatically. If you use other platform you may
need to unpack the files by hand.

:::

#### Training the data

:::info

This part might be a bit different if you use different platform than kaggle
(regarding uploading a file), but most of them will be similar, as you may need
to change some lines of code, and run some cells.

:::

Having your data ready, you need to upload it to your notebook. You get a copy
of our notebook when cloning repository, but you can also get it under this
[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleksanderszymaski/leorover-line-follower).

Once you have the notebook, you can upload the data using the **Add data**
button in the upper-right corner.

Then, just click on the **Upload** button, and drag your zip file (you also need
to provide a name for the dataset).

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/line-follower/line-follower-5.webp"
  alt="kaggle interface"
  width="922"
  height="618"
/>

:::info

You can also use our dataset. After going to **Add data** section type in the
search bar (upper-right corner) _"LeoRover"_ and you will see, our dataset.
Click blue _Add_ button, and the dataset will be added to your notebook.

:::

Once it's uploaded to the notebook, you should see something like this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/line-follower/line-follower-6.webp"
  width="192"
  height="144"
  figStyle={{
    width: 200,
  }}
/>

Now, you just have to run all the cells up to the "Custom tests" section to
begin the training.

:::warning

There is one cell, with variables that might need to change. Each of them has
provided description in a comment. Go through before running, and check if you
need to change something.

:::

When the training is finished, you'll see your `tflite` model (the name may
differ if you've changed the correct variable in the correct section) in the
output section.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/line-follower/line-follower-7.webp"
  width="293"
  height="143"
  figStyle={{
    width: 300,
  }}
/>

The only thing that you need now is to download the file and place it on the
rover. You can download the model by clicking the three dots that show up when
you go with the cursor over the file.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/line-follower/line-follower-8.webp"
  width="286"
  height="137"
  figStyle={{
    width: 300,
  }}
/>

Then, just press **Download** and the model will be downloaded. Now, you have to
place it on the rover, you can follow the instructions from
[this tutorial](/leo-rover/guides/upload-files-to-rover).

:::info

In the last section, notebook provides two functions to visualize model
features. Using them, you can visualize kernels from convolutional layers and
feature maps. Both functions are documented in the notebook, so just read them
to see all their parameters
