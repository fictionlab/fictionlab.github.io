An object detection example for stock Leo Rover

In this example, we will show you how to run Object Detection on the Leo Rover
mobile robot.

## What to expect?

After completing this tutorial, your rover should be able to recognize 91
objects from the COCO dataset
([listed here](https://blog.roboflow.com/coco-dataset/#coco-dataset-class-list)),
and display an image with drawn bounding boxes around the detected objects.

### Software integration

## Software integration

:::tip

Since LeoOS 1.1.0 release, leo_examples package is installed by default. If the
system is updated to at least 1.1.0 release you can skip software integration
part.

:::

:::info

To complete those steps, you need to connect to the rover's network first, and
then log in using ssh (both covered in prerequisites).

:::

:::info

One package in the _leo_examples_ repository depends on _ar_track_alvar_
package. As there is no release for the _ROS_ version running on the rover
(noetic) yet, you have to install it manually. To do so, type:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-ar-track-alvar
```

:::

Our neural network model was converted to
[TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite), so you need to install it on
your rover too:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install tflite-runtime
```

### Installing using apt

You can install the package using `apt` by typing **on the rover**:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-leo-examples
```

Then you just need to source the `ROS` workspace:

```bash
source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
```

### Building from source

You can also get all needed software from our
[leo_examples](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_examples) github repository. You
need to clone it on the rover in the ros workspace directory (if there's no such
a directory, then, first go through the
[ROS Development](/leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development) tutorial):

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_examples.git
```

Now, you need to install all the dependencies for the downloaded packages:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src -i
```

Then, you need to source the directory and build the packages:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
source devel/setup.bash
catkin build
```

:::info

If your installation went without any errors, then you have successfully
installed required software.

## Examples

### Using given models

Running the object detection node is very simple. First, you need to connect to
the rover via `ssh` (tutorial in prerequisites). Once you are logged in to the
rover, you can launch the node using `roslaunch` command:

```bash
roslaunch leo_example_object_detection detector.launch
```

The given launch file has a few arguments:

- **camera** - the name of the topic with the `Image` messages (you can specify
  it if you have changed basic setup on the rover or maybe have two cameras)
- **labels** - a path to the file with labels for the model (a parameter
  provided in case you want to try other neural network models that were trained
  on other datasets than `COCO`)
- **model** - a path to neural network model for object detection (the models
  given by us are in the `models` directory of the
  `leo_example_object_detection` package)
- **config_file** - a path to the yaml file with defined colors for given
  labels.

:::note

- Every argument has default value, so when launching the node, you don't need
  to specify any of them. They are for your use, if you want to change the
  default functionality.
- You can create your own **config_file**, the file needs to have two ros
  parameters _labels_ and _colors_. The first parameters is a list of strings,
  where each string is a label from the dataset, that was used for training the
  model. The second parameter is a list of lists, where each list has three
  numbers (color in rgb format). This way first label from the labels list will
  be in the first color from colors list, second label in the second color and
  so on. (You can always look for the _label_colors.yaml_ file in the _config_
  directory, to see the correct format of the file). For each label, that is not
  defined in this file, there is a default color, so you don't need to define
  all the labels.

:::

So, with some arguments your line can look like this:

```bash
roslaunch leo_example_object_detection detector.launch config_file:=/home/pi/ros_ws/src/leo_examples/leo_example_object_detection/config/my_colors.yaml
```

Now, you need to display the output of the model. As the connection via `ssh`
doesn't allow you to run GUI the applications (unless you run `ssh` with `-X`
flag), you will need to allow your computer to run `ROS` nodes with master being
on the rover. To do so, you need to go to `ROS` workspace on your computer,
source the workspace, and export some `ROS` environment variables:

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros_workspace>
source devel/setup.bash
export ROS_IP=<your_IP_address_in_the_rovers_network>
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://master.localnet:11311
```

:::info

You can check if you did everything right by typing on your computer rostopic
list. If you will see list of topics from the rover, then it means, that
everything is ok, and you can continue.

:::

Once you have done this, you can run `rqt` on your computer:

```bash
rqt
```

There, you need to run two things:

- `Image View` (Plugins -> Visualization -> Image View)
- `Dynamic Reconfigure` (Plugins -> Configuration -> Dynamic Reconfigure)

In `Image View`, from the topic drop down choose `/detections/compressed` - this
is the processed image with drawn detections on it.

In `Dynamic Reconfigure`, choose `object_detector`. You should see something
like this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/object-detection/object-detection-1.webp"
  alt="rqt setup for object detection with leo rover"
  width="1362"
  height="729"
/>

On the right side (in `Dynamic Reconfigure`), you can see a slider. It's a
slider for the `confidence` parameter - it specifies the confidence threshold
for the neural network guesses (only the detections with confidence higher than
the specified will be drawn). You can change the value to see how the detections
change.

Place objects inside the view of the camera and if they are a part of the
dataset, and the algorithm if confident enough that they are what they appear to
be what they really are, boxes around the item, and a text description will
appear.

  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/object-detection/object-detection-2.webp"
  alt="bottle and cup with drawn detection rectangles"
  width="1209"
  height="737"
/>

### Adding models of your choice

It's possible to run the node with your models (either made from scratch or
found on the internet). To launch the node with your files, you have the launch
arguments (explained above). You can specify their values to make the node use
your files.

:::info

If you provide model, that was trained on other dataset than COCO, then you will
need to give the node labels for your model too.

:::

:::warning

Not every object detection model will be compatible with our node. The models
that we have provided in the _models_ directory of the package, are pretrained,
single-shot detector models, converted to TensorFlow Lite from the TensorFlow
repository.

So if you want the model of your choice to be compatible with our node, the
model needs to follow such
[output signature](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/object_detection/overview#output_signature).

## What next?

After completing this tutorial, you can try other examples from the
[leo_examples](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_examples) repository
([line follower](line-follower) and [follow ARTag](follow-artag)), or try other
integration from our site.
