An ARTag follower example for a stock Leo Rover

In this example, we will show you how to make the Leo Rover mobile robot follow
an ARTag.

## What to expect?

After completing this tutorial, your rover should be able to follow a printed
ARTag.

## Prerequisites

<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/connect-to-rover-ap" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/guides/ssh" />
<LinkButton docId="leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development" />

## List of components

1. Any computer which you can connect to the rover via `ssh`.
2. Stock Leo Rover.

## Mechanical integration

The only physical thing you'll need to do is to print an ARTag:

- You can download an ARTag from
  [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=markers0to8.png)
  (you'll need only the one in the top-left corner), or you can follow the
  instruction on generating markers from
  [ros wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar#ar_track_alvar.2Fpost-fuerte.Generating_AR_tags).
- The printed ARTag needs to be 10cm x 10cm.
- The printed ARTag needs to have a white border around it.

Here's an example of our ARTag that we used for this task:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/robots/leo/integrations/follow-artag/follow-artag-1.webp"
  alt="leo rover alvar artag"
  width="1500"
  height="1410"
/>

:::info

Remember that the white border around the tag is necessary. You can leave the
printed tag on the peace of paper, but we do recommend, to attach it to some
harder material like cardboard - this way ARTag won't bend, so it will be easier
for the software to notice it.

:::

## Software integration

:::tip

Since LeoOS 1.1.0 release, leo_examples package is installed by default. If the
system is updated to at least 1.1.0 release you can skip software integration
part.

:::

:::info

To complete those steps, you need to connect to the rover's network first, and
then log in using ssh (both covered in prerequisites).

:::

:::info

One package in the _leo_examples_ repository depends on _ar_track_alvar_
package. As there is no release for the _ROS_ version running on the rover
(noetic) yet, you have to install it manually. To do so, type:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-ar-track-alvar
```

:::

### Installing using apt

You can install the package using `apt` by typing **on the rover**:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-leo-examples
```

Then you just need to source the `ROS` workspace:

```bash
source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
```

### Building from source

You can also get all needed software from our
[leo_examples](https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_examples) github repository. You
need to clone it on the rover in the ros workspace directory (if there's no such
a directory, then, first go through the
[ROS development](/leo-rover/advanced-guides/ros-development) tutorial):

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/LeoRover/leo_examples.git
```

Now, you need to install all the dependencies for the downloaded packages:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src -i
```

Then, you need to source the directory and build the packages:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
source devel/setup.bash
catkin build
```

:::info

If your installation went without any errors, then you have successfully
installed required software.

:::

## Examples

To run the example, you need to be connected to the rover via ssh. Once you do
this, type in the terminal:

```bash
roslaunch leo_example_follow_ar_tag follow_ar_tag.launch
```

The rover will start following the ARTag once it detects it.

:::warning

The rover will follow only the ARTag with id 0, so it's important that you print
the correct one - specified in the Mechanical Integration (Don't forget about
the white border).

:::

## What next?

After completing this tutorial, you can try other examples from the leo_examples
repository ([line follower](line-follower) and
[object detection](object-detection)), or try other integration from our site.
