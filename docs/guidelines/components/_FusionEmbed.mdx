## FusionEmbed

`FusionEmbed` is a component designed to embed Autodesk Fusion CAD models into
the page. It loads the CAD model only after the user requests it by clicking a
link, thereby improving page load speed.

It is not loaded by default, therefore it requires importing:

```jsx
import FusionEmbed from '@site/src/components/FusionEmbed';
```

Basic usage:

```jsx
<FusionEmbed
  url="https://kellideas.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH512d4QTec90decfa6e0b1bf29fda603dd6" \\ link to CAD model
  embedTitle="Leo Rover 3D model" \\ iframe name
/>
```

### FusionEmbed arguments

`url="cad_model_url"` \
Link to Fusion CAD model. It has to be in `kellideas.autodesk360.com` domain.

`embedTitle="cad model description"` \
Embedded CAD model description. Used mostly by browser bots (SEO).

`loading="lazy" | "eager"` optional, default `lazy` \
Define if overlay image should be lazy loaded or not. CAD model image should be
eager loaded if it is in the user's initial viewport (visible during page
loading). Otherwise it should be lazy loaded.

`img="image_path"` optional, by default cube is displayed \

An image displayed as the background if the user has not clicked to load the 3D
model. It is hidden when the model is loaded. It is recommended to set this
image as a preview to indicate which model will be shown after loading.

`alt="alternative text"` required if `img` is set \
Alternative text shown if image cannot be displayed.

`img_width={number}` required if `img` is set \
`img_height={number}` required if `img` is set \
Real dimensions of the image in pixels.

:::note

Right now it is not possible to style this component using CSS.
