## LinkButton

The component facilitates the addition of buttons directing to internal or
external pages. The `LinkButton` is integrated by default and does not require
importing.

The usage of this component varies based on whether the page is located within
current sidebar or not.

### Automatic links

For pages included in the current sidebar (regardless of their depth in the
structure), it is necessary to specify the `docId` of the selected page. To
understand how Docusaurus specifies ID of documents, see:
[Document ID - docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc#document-id).

#### Example usage

```jsx
<LinkButton docId="guidelines/guidelines" />
```

Is rendered:

<LinkButton docId="guidelines/guidelines" />

:::note

Due to Docusaurus limitations, this method can only link to pages within the
currently selected sidebar (i.e., pages visible on the left). To link to pages
located beyond this sidebar, please refer to [Manual links](#manual-links).

For instance, this page cannot link to pages in the Leo Rover category.

### Manual links

When employing `LinkButton` to link external pages or pages outside the current
sidebar, it is essential to provide additional arguments since Docusaurus itself
cannot retrieve them.

Basic usage:

```jsx
<LinkButton url="https://leorover.tech" title="Link title" />
```

#### Arguments

`url="link_url"` \
The link provided can be either relative (e.g., `/leo-rover/documentation/docusaurus`
) or absolute ( e.g., `https://leorover.tech` ).

`title="link title"` \
Title of the link.

`description="description of the link"` \
Description of the link, put below the title.

`icon="🤖"` \
An optional custom icon placed alongside the title. When used in manual mode, `LinkButton`
automatically detects the link type. By default, emojis are:

- `📄` for pages
- `🗃️` for categories
- `🔗` for external links

#### Example usage

```jsx
<LinkButton
  url="https://leorover.tech"
  title="Link title"
  description="Some description."
  icon="🏠"
/>
```

Is rendered:

<LinkButton
  url="https://leorover.tech"
  title="Link title"
  description="Some description."
  icon="🏠"
/>
