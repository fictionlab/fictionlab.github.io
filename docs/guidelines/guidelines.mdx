  Fictionlab documentation.

This section provides guidelines for writing additional content for Fictionlab
documentation. It includes a list of available React components and templates
for different page types, such as addons and integrations.

### Formatting

All pages within [Fictionlab documentation](/) should be consistently formatted
to ensure standardization and clarity for the reader. To consolidate all the
rules, a dedicated page has been created that contains all the styles currently
used in the documentation.

<LinkButton docId="guidelines/formatting" />

### React components

To ensure consistency across all pages, we created additional React components
that automatically apply the necessary styles and properties. To see a list of
all available components, visit:
