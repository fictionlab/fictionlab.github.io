   - Create new [ProductPreview](/guidelines/components#productpreview) partial
     markdown file. Name should look like this `_addon-name-product.mdx`
   - Create new `.mdx` file **named the same as folder**
3. When copying and filling this template, remove all comments
   (`{/* comment example  */}` ).
4. When copying directly from `.mdx` file, remove all code blocks (only fencing,
   leave content).
5. Inline code indicates that this fragment needs to be replaced with other
   content, such as a React component, description, etc.
