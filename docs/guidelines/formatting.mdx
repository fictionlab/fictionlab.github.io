Fictionlab documentation is written in `MDXv3` format. It is an markdown with
possibility to insert HTML and React components.

## General rules

When it comes to general documentation writing rules it is best to **look
around**. Match the style you see used in the rest of the project. If something
is inconsistent or you have doubts, feel free to report it via
[github issues](https://github.com/fictionlab/docs/issues),
[e-mail](mailto:contact@fictionlab.pl) or any other means.

Here are some tips to help you write nice document:

- When it comes to images, use only
  [ImageZoom](/guidelines/components#imagezoom) or
  [ThemedImageZoom](/guidelines/components#themedimagezoom) components.
- If you have trouble with style, spelling etc., **ChatGPT** can be great ally.

- For tutorials that have multiple possible paths, for example different
  commands for Linux and Windows systems, use
  [Tabs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs). Different use case
  is for different hardware versions of a rover.
- When it comes to file naming avoid using underscores (`_`), use dashes (`-`)
  instead.
- Use only lowercase letters in file names.

### Front matter

> Front matter is used to add metadata to your Markdown file. All content
> plugins have their own front matter schema, and use the front matter to enrich
> the default metadata inferred from the content or other configuration.
>
> [docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features#front-matter)

All documents included in Fictionlab documentation are required to have
following Front matter fields:

```yml
---
title: # title of the document
sidebar_label: # title of the document on the sidebar
keywords: # few keywords that describe the document, recommended 4-5
description: # text description about document content, up to 160 characters
image: # path to image that is shown when embedding link on social media, in Google etc.
---
```

The following fields are associated with the document's Search Engine
Optimization (SEO) parameters.

In addition it is possible to set additional fields:

`id: document_ID` \
Used to set custom ID of the document. By default it is taken from the file
name.

:::warning

This parameter defines only the final segment of the ID. The preceding segments
are derived from the file structure.

:::

`sidebar_position: number` \
This parameter is used to set a custom order for the documents within
categories. By default, the documents are arranged alphabetically.

:::note

All documents within a particular category must have this parameter set to
ensure correct ordering.

:::

`slug: document_slug` \
Used to set custom URL slug of the article. By default file name is used.

:::note

The slug can be set as either relative (`page-slug`) or absolute (`/page-slug`).
Relative slugs will have preceding segments derived from the file structure,
while absolute slugs will be served directly at the page root.

:::

There are additional possible fields, but the ones mentioned above are typically
sufficient for setting the document's metadata correctly. For a complete list of
possible fields, refer to the
[Markdown front matter documentation on docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-front-matte).

### Images

- When it comes to images, use only
  [ImageZoom](/guidelines/components#imagezoom) or
  [ThemedImageZoom](/guidelines/components#themedimagezoom) components.
- Do not use underscores `_` in names, use dashes instead `-`.
- Name images descriptively, avoid names like `323d2324.webp`.
  - When there are multiple images in a document (such as a manual), you can
    keep the same name and add numbering to them. For example:
    `battery-10.webp`.
- All images should be stored in `/docs/static/img` directory.
- All images should be converted into `webp` format. It is more modern, thus
  more space efficient. Default quality should be `80` with `lossy` setting. For
  image conversion, you can use tools such as
  [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) or
  [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php).

#### Themed images

In addition, images with different versions for light and dark mode should
include the `-light` or `-dark` suffix in their filenames. For example,
`leo-rover-render-light.webp`.

- The `-light` suffix indicates that the image is intended for use in light
  mode. For example, such images should feature **black text**.
- The `-dark` suffix indicates that the image is intended for use in dark mode.
  For example, such images should feature **white text**.

Themed images should have the same dimensions and should represent the same
content.

### Empty sections

If document is scheduled to be published before full completion. Do not leave
empty sections. It can be mistaken as an oversight.

To mark unfinished section add `TODO` mdx comment and _Work in progress_ text
for the users.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
