Fictionlab documentation is written in `MDXv3` format. It is an markdown with
possibility to insert HTML and React components.

To see whats possible with markdown, see this guide:

## General rules

When it comes to general documentation writing rules it is best to **look
around**. Match the style you see used in the rest of the project. If something
is inconsistent or you have doubts, feel free to report it via
[github issues](https://github.com/fictionlab/docs/issues),
[e-mail](contact@fictionlab.pl) or any other means.

Here are some tips to help you write nice document:

- When it comes to images, use only
  [ImageZoom](/guidelines/components#imagezoom) or
  [ThemedImageZoom](/guidelines/components#themedimagezoom) components.
- If you have trouble with style, spelling etc., **ChatGPT** can be great ally.

- For tutorials that have multiple possible paths, for example different
  commands for Linux and Windows systems, use
  [Tabs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs). Different use case
  is for different hardware versions of a rover.
- When it comes to file naming avoid using underscores (`_`), use dashes (`-`)
  instead.

### Images

- When it comes to images, use only
  [ImageZoom](/guidelines/components#imagezoom) or
  [ThemedImageZoom](/guidelines/components#themedimagezoom) components.
- Do not use underscores `_` in names, use dashes instead `-`.
- Name images descriptively, avoid names like `323d2324.webp`.
  - When there are multiple images in a document (such as a manual), you can
    keep the same name and add numbering to them. For example:
    `battery-10.webp`.
- All images should be stored in `/docs/static/img` directory.
- All images should be converted into `webp` format. It is more modern, thus
  more space efficient. Default quality should be `80` with `lossy` setting.
